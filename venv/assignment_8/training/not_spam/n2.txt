Go FarÂ® Rewards is discontinuing digital rewards
What's happening 
We're making some updates to our Go Far Rewards redemption and rewards pool options. Effective immediately, we will no longer offer rewards redemptions for digital music, books, and games. 

What this means 
You will no longer be able to redeem your rewards for digital music, eBooks, audio books, eMagazines, and games. 

This will not affect any digital rewards you have already redeemed; but any digital rewards you may have saved for later will no longer appear in your Favorites. 

No action is required 
You do not need to do anything. If you'd like to explore other redemption options, sign on to Go Far Rewards. 

Questions? 
If you have questions, call us at 1-877-517-1358. We're available 7 days a week 8:00 am to midnight, Eastern Time (excluding major holidays). We accept relay service calls.
