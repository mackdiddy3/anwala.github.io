Hey Backers!

We’ve not ssslid into your inboxes for at least a month, so we thought we’d drop by.

Just a couple of things this time:

You may have heard of Yooka-Laylee and the Kracklestone, a graphic novel by Dreamprism Press. Good news, their Backerkit store is now live!

If you missed out on the campaign and fancy nabbing a book (last chance to get a first print run copy), or simply want to peruse some Yooka-Laylee bits and bobs, head on over. 


They say you shouldn't share your pin, but we'll take our chances.

As for us, we’ve just finished recording the final episode of the Yooka-Laylee Developer Commentary series, and we’re a 6it excited for 4pril Fools' Day. 

We’ve got a cool year ahead of us, stay tuned.
