VERY URGENT BUSINESS TRANSACTION

In order to transfer out (USD 60 million dollars) from
our bank. I have the courage to ask you to look for a
reliable and honest person who will be capable for
this important business believing that you will never
let me down either now or in future. I am Mr.Sarrid Masmorouh
the eastern district bank manager of bank of africa plc(BA).
An account was opened
in this bank in 1980 and since 1990 nobody has
operated on this account again. After going through
some of the old files in the records, I discovered that
if I do not remit this money out urgently, it will be
forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is
DR.Smith Andrews, a foreigner, he died since 1990. No
other person knows about this account or any thing
concerning it. the account has no other beneficiary
and my investigation proved to me as well that his
family does not know anything about this account.
I want to transfer this money into a safe foreigners
account abroad but I don~Rt know any foreigner, I am
only contacting you as a foreigner because this money
can not be approved to a local bank here, but can only
be approved to any foreign account because the money
is in us dollars and the former owner of the account
is a foreigner too. I know
that this massage will come to you as a surprise as we
don~Rt know our selves before, but be sure that it is
real and a genuine business. I only got your contact
address accidentally through the computer
with believe in God that
you will never let me down in this business. you are
the only person that I have contacted in this
business, so please reply urgently so that I will
inform you the next step to take urgently. Send also
your private telephone and fax number including the
full details of the account to be used for the
deposit. I will also like us to sign a
binding agreement to bind us together so that you can
receive this money into a foreign account or any
account of your choice where the fund will be safe.
I will fly to your country for withdrawal and
sharing and other investments. I am contacting you
because of the need to involve a foreigner with
foreign account and foreign beneficiary. I need your
full co-operation to make this work fine Because the
management is ready to approve the payment to any
foreigner who has correct information of this account,
which I will give to you later , if you are
able and with capability to handle such amount in
strict confidence and trust according to my
instructions and advice for our mutual benefit because
this opportunity may not come to me again.
I need truthful person in this business because I don~Rt
want to make mistake. I need your strong assurance and
trust. With my position now in the office I can
transfer this money to any foreigner~Rs reliable
account, which you can provide with assurance that
this money will be intact pending my physical arrival
in your country for sharing. I will destroy all
documents of transaction immediately we receive this
money leaving no trace to any place.>I will apply for
annual leave to get visa immediately i hear from you
that you are ready to act and receive this fund in
your account. I will use my position and influence to
effect legal approvals and onward transfer of this
money to your account with appropriate clearance forms
of the ministries and foreign exchange department. At
the conclusion of this business, i will give you 35%
of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5%
will be for expenses both parties might have incurred
during the process of transaction. I look forward to
your earliest reply by E-mail:
