Notice of Policy Updates
Dear Mack,
We are updating the PayPal Account User Agreement and the Electronic Communications Delivery Policy. These changes will go into effect on March 29, 2019 and apply to U.S. PayPal customers. If you're interested in more detail, please visit our Policy Update Page.
What you'll see in the updated User Agreement for personal PayPal accounts
As a result of a new regulation issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in Washington, D.C. coming into effect on April 1, 2019, we are making some changes that will affect consumers who want to hold and use balance with PayPal.
Beginning March 29, 2019, if you want to hold and use balance, in addition to verifying your identity with PayPal, you will need a balance account which will be linked to your current PayPal account. Detailed information about balance accounts (known as PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus) can be found in the PayPal Cash and PayPal Cash Plus Terms and Conditions.
There are no changes to any PayPal fees.
We are also making two other changes: (1) we are changing the time period for providing you with advance notice about important changes to the PayPal Account User Agreement to at least 21 days; and (2) we are clarifying how and when we convert currency.
What you'll see in the updated Electronic Communications Delivery Policy

We are updating our Electronic Communications Delivery Policy to clarify that your consent to receive electronic disclosures under our Electronic Communications Delivery Policy applies to all PayPal branded accounts. 

When these changes go into effect 

These changes are detailed on our Policy Update Page and will go into effect on March 29, 2019. If you agree to these changes, you don’t have to do anything. If you don’t agree with these changes, you may close your account. If you close your account before March 29, 2019, the changes will not apply to you.

Thank you for being a PayPal customer. 

Sincerely, 
PayPal
