Jesse David Vasquez Jr., 44, was fatally shot April 17, 2016. His 24-year-old son, Jesse David Vasquez III, is charged with the killing.
Torres testified that she heard “pops” from the house diagonally across from hers. When she crossed the street to see what happened, she looked inside the house and saw Ann Vasquez, the victim’s wife, attempting CPR on her husband, the newspaper reported.
The younger Vasquez was outside the home, appearing “high, kinda nervous and frightened,” the witness said.
When she asked why he shot his father, Vasquez shrugged, Torres said.
“He said he didn’t regret it, he wasn’t sorry,” she recalled, according to the newspaper.
Police arrived at the scene, but the father died before he could receive medical attention, according to the report.
In an opening statement, prosecutor Josh Sandoval told the jury that the younger Vasquez had talked about wanting to kill his father, the Express-News reported.
