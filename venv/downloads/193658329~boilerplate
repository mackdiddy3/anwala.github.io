If anyone feared another mail bomb had been found in North Carolina on Tuesday, you can now stop believin'.
Evacuations and street closures caused by the discovery of a "suspicious package" were quickly ended when responders discovered the parcel only contained a cassette tape of the band Journey.
Authorities rushed to the Duke Energy Building in Charlotte after employees found a “suspicious package” and called 911 at 6:12 a.m., FOX46 reported.
But it turns out, the manila envelope only held a tape of the 1980s-era rock group of "Dont Stop Believin'" fame.
"To be clear, this is a suspicious package call and not a bomb threat," police told FOX46.
The call prompted street closures surrounding the building on South Tryon Street.
Duke Energy tweeted just after 8 a.m. the scene was cleared.
“A suspicious package was discovered at the 400 South Tryon Street building. Following strict protocol, 911 was called. @CMPD investigated and determined the package posed no danger. The scene has been cleared,” the tweet read.
