Ningen Restaurant, meaning “human restaurant,” opened in the city’s red light district this month, serving last meals requested by famous death row inmates like double-murderer Gary Mark Gilmore, who requested a hamburger, baked potato, hard-boiled egg and three Jack Daniels shots; “Black Widow” Judy Buonoano, who dined on asparagus, broccoli, tomatoes and strawberries; and a rendition of killer clown John Wayne Gacy’s bucket of KFC, french fries, pound of strawberries and fried shrimp – among others.
The pop-up, which runs until October 28, is part of a larger art installation by Chim↑Pom art collective, Insider reports. The exhibit features works of art by Austrian avant-garde artist Hermann Nitsch and performances by local artists, the publication reports.
