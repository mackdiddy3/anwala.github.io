Realm said the ghost asked her to get married during a trip to celebrate their nine-month relationship at England’s Wookey Hole caves, according to The Sun.
“There was no going down on one knee — he doesn’t have knees. But for the first time, I heard him speak,” she told The Sun. “I could actually hear his voice and it was beautiful. Deep, sexy and real.”
The 30-year-old said she met her spooky match, who doesn’t have a name, during a work trip to Australia in February.
“I’d not had a phantom fling for a while and as I was away on business, starting a new relationship was the last thing on my mind,” the Bristol-based spiritual counselor told The Sun. “Then one day, while I was walking through the bush, enjoying nature, I suddenly felt this incredible energy. A new lover had arrived.”
Realm said her friends and family have embraced her unusual engagement and now she is planning her big day as a “Pagan” ceremony.
“We haven’t discussed the details yet but I think it will be quite a big do,” she said.
However, the couple already had sex on the plane back from Australia when they first met.
“I was happy and excited — so excited that we had to do something about it,” she said. “So we headed to the plane loo and, well, I am now a member of the Mile High Club.”
