The unidentified man, who is holding a bag of what appears to be produce to purchase, is seen taking the ladle out of the soup pot and sipping from it.
The video, which appears to have originated on Reddit, has gathered over 1 million views across social media and received swift reactions from Twitter users — most of whom called the video “the scariest” and “disgusting.”
As expected, there were a few “Seinfeld” soup references.
The Reddit user who claimed to have captured the footage added that the video shows the man's second attempt to covertly eat from the hot bar. The witness claims to have notified security right after the footage was shot.
The name of the grocery store was not reported, but one eagle-eyed Twitter user claimed it was likely a Mariano’s supermarket in the metropolitan Chicago area, “based on the Vero coffee in the background and their sushi station in the corner.”
