Sen. Ron Johnson appeared on "Your World" Thursday to weigh in on several topics, including the caravan of thousands of migrants headed for the U.S. border.
FoxNews.com reported Thursday that roughly 800 U.S. troops are set to make their way to the southern border to help Homeland Security and National Guard troops deal with the migrant caravan that's making its way north through Mexico. A U.S. official said the soldiers will offer â€œlogistical support," including providing tents and vehicles.
Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, railed against current U.S. immigration policies, which he said incentivize migrants to come to the U.S. and claim asylum.
"Our system is so broken. We have stupid laws. ... We have legal loopholes that are being exploited right now," Johnson said. "We incentivize people to come to the country illegally because we reward them."
He explained that migrants can claim asylum and remain in the country during the lengthy adjudication and appeals processes.
"What we need is we need consequences. ... If there are consequences, people will stop coming illegally," Johnson said, noting that the Department of Homeland Security has implemented "expedited removals" of illegal immigrants in the past.
He said if foreign nationals want to file valid asylum claims, they should do so in their home countries.
"Then we can adjudicate it properly, legally, and we can set our refugee limits at acceptable levels where we can assimilate people," Johnson said.
