A Good Samaritan who stopped to help victims of a car crash on a California freeway died Thursday after she was hit by an SUV, authorities said.
The woman, identified as 19-year-old Bertha Aida Estrada by the San Diego County Medical Examinerâ€™s Office, had stopped along the eastbound lanes of state Route 94 after witnessing the crash.
California Highway Patrol said an 82-year-old woman driving a gray Mercedes sedan was rear-ended by a 23-year-old woman driving a Honda Civic, the San Diego Tribune reported.
After getting hit, the driver of the Mercedes lost control of the vehicle and slammed into the concrete wall of the center divider. The sedan ended up blocking the left-side lanes of the freeway, police said.
