Syndicated radio host Dennis Prager said that President Trump is driving the left crazy and drawing the line for being unapologetic in his words and actions.
Prager -- who's film "No Safe Spaces" with comedian Adam Carolla explores the suppression of free speech on college campuses -- said to Tucker Carlson that Trump "marches on" despite any backlash from the left.
"[Trump] has said some ridiculous things, even some bad things. Fully acknowledged," said Prager. "Nevertheless, he does not apologize to the left. He is the ultimate nemesis of the left because he doesn't care what they say."
He said that those on the left wish invoking fear to President Trump would work, and they then resort to more aggressive tactics.
