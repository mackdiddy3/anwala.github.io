The 50-seat, twin-engine jet was attempting to take off from Williamsport Regional Airport in Montoursville, Penn., shortly after 6 a.m. when the aircraft’s running gear hit the deer, the airport’s executive director, Thomas J. Hart, confirmed to PennLive.
After returning to the gate, passengers were rebooked on other airlines, a representative for American Airlines told Fox News. The American Eagle flight was being operated by Piedmont Airlines, a subsidiary of American Airlines.
Hart told PennLive the deer likely scaled a perimeter fence, though such occurrences are rare.
