Parents of Hopewell Valley High School students attending a game against Trenton Central High School shouted at players to "Speak English" because "This is America" at the opposing team's junior varsity players, NJ.com reported Wednesday.
Trenton school district's enrollment, according to the news outlet, is mostly Hispanic with 5,728 of its 11,118 students being of Hispanic descent. Of Hopewell's 3,518 students, 163 are reportedly Hispanic.
