In a special report, MSNBC Chief Legal Correspondent, Ari Melber, breaks down a central question in modern American politics: Can a sitting President be indicted? Melber examines how the constitution’s core remedy for a President who commits “high crimes or misdemeanours” is through Congress and the power of impeachment, but that this doesn’t legally mean a sitting President cannot be indicted. Melber also walks through how both the Special Counsel in the Watergate investigation and Ken Starr, in the investigation of Bill Clinton, have both argued that a President could, in fact, be indicted while in Office and that while DOJ guidelines recommend against it, if Mueller thought there was a public interest requirement to indict Trump, he could ask Attorney General Bill Barr for an exception.Feb. 21, 2019
