House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Tuesday morning police are looking for two men suspected of throwing a boulder through his office window.
Surveillance video shows the two men - believed to be between 20 and 30 years old - outside the office in Bakersfield. They then entered the office and stole computer equipment, he told "Fox & Friends."
McCarthy asked his Instagram followers if they recognized the two men from the surveillance shots.
Tomi Lahren joined Steve Doocy on "Fox & Friends" Thursday to preview the new episode of Fox Nation's "No Interruption," which investigates the murder of an American man in a popular tourist destination in Mexico.
