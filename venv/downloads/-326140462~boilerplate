Liberal Hollywood actor Jim Carrey and GOP Texas Senator Ted Cruz engaged in a contentious back-and-forth on Twitter Monday, just hours before voters in the state head to polling stations to help determine Cruz’s fate in the Senate.
“Go Beto! Go Democrats! Vote like there’s no tomorrow,” the “Ace Ventura” star tweeted Monday. “Let’s make this Tuesday like the end of every great vampire movie. Pull back the curtains and let the sunshine turn all those bloodsuckers to dust.”
“Wow...sorry I rattled your chain, @TedCruz,” the actor wrote. “I thought you would have more important things to do two days before an election — like sucking up to the guy who called your wife ugly and accused your dad of murder. But I get it! It’s hard to say no when Trump grabs ya by the p----!”
President Trump and the Texas senator had a contentious relationship during the last presidential primary season but apparently mended ties ahead of Tuesday’s midterm elections.
