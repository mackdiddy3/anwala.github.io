Homan added that the military will be important in stopping potential drug smugglers within the caravan.
"This is national security. This is more than illegal immigration," he said.
President Trump has repeatedly called for the caravan to retreat, tweeting on Wednesday that there are "many more troops coming."
Our military is being mobilized at the Southern Border. Many more troops coming. We will NOT let these Caravans, which are also made up of some very bad thugs and gang members, into the U.S. Our Border is sacred, must come in legally. TURN AROUND!
Homan said that with more troops at the border, a larger number of Border Patrol agents can carry out their law enforcement duties. He said when a large number of individuals show up at the border, it ties up Border Patrol resources, allowing drug smuggler to operate in other areas.
Following Michael Cohen's public testimony before Congress, Judge Andrew Napolitano said President Trump's former attorney alleged no impeachable offenses, but he did give Democrats a "treasure trove of stuff" with which to torment the president.
