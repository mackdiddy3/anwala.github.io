An American Airlines baggage handler who fell asleep in the cargo hold of a plane, which flew from Kansas City to Chicago, admitted to police that alcohol was the reason for his snooze.
The worker, only identified as an employee of Piedmont Airlines, was working at Kansas City International Airport on Saturday, Oct. 27, when he "inadvertently fell asleep in the forward cargo hold of a Boeing 737-800 aircraft," American Airlines said in a statement obtained by Fox News.
