Defense Secretary James Mattis denied on Wednesday that sending troops to the border was any type of stunt, with the midterm elections just three days away.

The armed troops will be sent to the border to perform logistical and support functions as the migrant caravan continues to move north.
Bongino added on Saturday that Democrats have been dishonest about the immigration debate and that "they're not serious about it."
Following Michael Cohen's public testimony before Congress, Judge Andrew Napolitano said President Trump's former attorney alleged no impeachable offenses, but he did give Democrats a "treasure trove of stuff" with which to torment the president.
