Numerous packages containing suspected explosive devices were intercepted en route to some of the country’s most prominent Democratic political figures – including former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton – putting law enforcement on high alert Wednesday and prompting evacuations and sweeps of facilities across the country.
CNN employees were evacuated from their New York office Wednesday morning due to a suspicious package at the Time Warner Center. CNN said the package with a suspicious device was addressed to ex-CIA director John Brennan, who is an analyst for NBC.
Fox News chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge analyzed a photograph of the package addressed to Brennan, which she said contains "tell-tale signs" of a suspicious package.
She pointed to the excessive nature of the postage and packaging and "simplistic" address text.
"The package was recovered. And as we learned earlier today, it was not just containing explosives but also a white powder. And they're trying to determine whether that is inert or it may be something more serious like anthrax," Herridge reported.
Herridge noted that the individuals who were "targeted" -- if they were targeted by the same person or persons -- are all high-profile Democrats, but it is not yet known if there was any kind of political motivation.
In the latest incident, a law enforcement source told Fox News that U.S. Capitol Police are investigating a suspicious package addressed to Democratic California Rep. Maxine Waters. The package is at the Capitol Hill screening facility in Maryland.
