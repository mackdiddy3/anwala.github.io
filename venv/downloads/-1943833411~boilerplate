Bill Cosby's trial judge has rejected his bid for a new trial or sentencing hearing after "an exhausting review" of post-trial motions, prompting Camille Cosby to again accuse the judge of bias against her husband.
The judge's ruling Tuesday led Cosby's lawyers to file their appeal with the state Superior Court, the next step in trying to reverse his felony sex assault conviction.
Cosby is serving a three- to 10-year state prison term after a jury this year found he drugged and molested a woman in 2004.
