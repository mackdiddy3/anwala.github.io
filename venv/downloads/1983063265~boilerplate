Army Pfc. Mathis O. Ball went missing in 1950 following a combat operation in South Korea.
Now, military officials have identified the remains of the 20-year-old Texas soldier, who had been declared missing in action in the Korean War.
Military authorities said Ball's company was fighting North Korean forces in July 1950. Remains were recovered later that year from an isolated grave and ultimately interred in Honolulu as an unknown soldier.
