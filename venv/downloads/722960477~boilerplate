Responding officers found homeowner Dawn Lisa-DesVoigne holding the burglar at gunpoint. The burglar was identified as 20-year-old Edward Cerf of Oregon City. Deputies said they found Cerf's presumed accomplice, Gabriella Solis, asleep in a vehicle a block away. Solis reportedly told authorities she was the designated lookout.
Lisa-DesVoigne and her boyfriend, Troy Eton, told police they had been hit by multiple burglaries, which compelled them to install a security camera.
"We were tired of being victimized, tired of being traumatized and violated," Lisa-DesVoigne said.
"We were tired of being victimized, tired of being traumatized and violated."
The couple credited their security system with helping them thwart the latest burglary attempt, Portland's KOIN-TV reported. It was not clear whether Cerf and Solis were linked to the previous break-ins.
Cerf and Solis were arrested and charged with second-degree burglary, according to the station. They were booked into the Clackamas County Jail.
