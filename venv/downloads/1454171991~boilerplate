GM's next electric vehicle is a bicycle
General Motors has promised to have 20 electric vehicles on sale by 2023, but it looks like there will actually be 22.
The automaker has announced plans to introduce a pair of electric bicycles next year.

One has a fixed frame, while the other is foldable. GM hasn’t said if they are purely pedal-assist or have throttles, but they are “connected” and were developed with help from “great minds from the bike industry.”
