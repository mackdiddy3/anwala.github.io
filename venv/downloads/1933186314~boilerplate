A server at a restaurant in North Carolina was given a $10,000 cash tip by a patron who ordered two waters.
Alaina Custer, an employee of Sup Dogs in Greenville and student of nearby East Carolina University, was shocked when she discovered the stack of bills left on the table Saturday.
“I literally didn’t think it was real. I picked it up and it was a giant stack of hundreds, I was shaking and just kept asking, ‘What is this?’ I thought someone was playing a joke on me,” she told The News & Observer.
This isn’t the first time Mr. Beast has given away a large chunk of money and recorded it for YouTube. In another video on his page, he gives away $10,000 to a “random homeless man” and shares the encounter online.
As of Monday morning, the video of Custer’s reaction had yet be posted on Mr. Beast’s account.
