After a series of packages containing suspected explosive devices were sent to prominent Democratic political figures, President Donald Trump declared that acts or threats of political violence "have no place in the United States."
Packages addressed to former President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Rep. Maxine Waters, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and former CIA director John Brennan have been intercepted, putting law enforcement on high alert Wednesday and prompting evacuations and sweeps of facilities across the country.
Trump said he just concluded a briefing with the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and Secret Service, and a major federal investigation is underway.
"The full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable acts to justice. We will spare no resources or expense in this effort," Trump said.
