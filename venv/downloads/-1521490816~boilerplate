Los Angeles woman shaken when she sees a man with a bandaged head and hand wandering the freeway carrying a knife with his eyes closed.
A knife-wielding man seen with bandages covering his face and wearing hospital scrubs seen wandering on a Los Angeles freeway this week was not playing a pre-Halloween prank, authorities said.
The unknown man was seen walking in the middle of traffic on Interstate 10 as passing vehicles slowed down around him. A motorist recorded video of the incident on her cell phone, FOX 11 Los Angeles reported.
"This is just a bizarre coincidence like walking dead scenario. This guy is in the middle of the highway - even if it is a prank, he is not mentally sound," driver Lisa Shields said. "Tape around the head. Bandaged head, bandaged left hand, and carrying something in his right hand which I got close enough to see was a knife."
Shields said she pulled beside the man and saw that his eyes were closed. She called 911 soon after.
