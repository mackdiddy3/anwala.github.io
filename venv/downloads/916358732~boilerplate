If Kim does visit, he would be the first North Korean leader to visit the South Korean capital since the 1950-1953 Korean War ended in a cease-fire.
Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, became the first member of the ruling Kim family to visit Seoul in February, when she attended the Winter Olympics in South Korea as a special envoy and conveyed Kim's desire for a summit with Moon.
Moon on Thursday also said that a second summit between North Korea and the U.S. is "near at hand," adding that Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to visit North Korea and that Kim is to travel to Russia soon.
