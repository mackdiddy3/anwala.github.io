An unidentified woman filed a $6 million lawsuit this week, claiming that NHL player Evander Kane of the San Jose Sharks failed to compensate her for abortion procedures undergone while they were a couple.
The woman claims that Kane, 27, impregnated her three times after they began dating in 2015, and that Kane forced her to end the last two pregnancies after they mutually agreed to end the first, TMZ reported. Kane split that calendar year between the Winnipeg Jets and Buffalo Sabres. He didn't join San Jose until February of this year.
"We firmly believe that this lawsuit is baseless both factually and legally," Cambria Jr. said. "We will aggressively defend this claim in court on Evander's behalf and assert all applicable counterclaims."
Kane was traded to the Sharks in February after a two-year stint with the Sabres. In May Kane signed a seven-year extension with the Sharks estimated to be nearly $50 million, according to TMZ.
