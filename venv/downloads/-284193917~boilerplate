Medical staff compared the diagnosis to “the death of another child,” Andersen recalled, adding she lost her first son nearly two decades ago. She said doctors told her to let go of “hopes and dreams” she’d had for McKenzie, and to instead create new ones.
So far, there have been 62 confirmed cases of the illness across 22 states this year, according to the CDC. But the health agency says there have been at least 155 reports of patients under investigation for the polio-like illness.
Andersen hopes people will pay attention as reports of AFM across the country continue to climb.
“We need to get this under control,” Andersen said.
McKenzie was put on a ventilator after the part of the brain that controls breathing and her spinal cord became swollen. Now 10 years old, the girl is “a neck-down quadriplegic” and using a breathing machine.

However, there have been some minor improvements: McKenzie’s thumb is now working, and she’s felt “some flickers throughout her fingers.” The youngster also regained some right hip flexion and can “finger walk” using her left hand, Andersen added.
McKenzie is getting spinal rods inserted on Oct. 31 to help correct her scoliosis, which she developed “after being paralyzed” and has gotten worse, Andersen said.
If you notice any symptoms linked to the illness, Andersen recommended getting checked right way.
