Alex Trebek has hinted that he may be ready to step away from 'Jeopardy,' the game show he's hosted since 1984, and even went as far as to suggest potential replacements.
Alex Trebek will be hosting “Jeopardy!” until at least 2022.
Trebek, along with “Wheel of Fortune” hosts Pat Sajak and Vanna White, renewed their contracts with Sony Pictures Television to continue their roles in the popular game shows through the 2021 and 2022 seasons, Deadline reported.
“Pat, Vanna and Alex are simply the best. Night after night, they seamlessly entertain generations of fans on two of the most beloved television programs on air. We are thrilled that they’ll continue to do so through 2022,” Mike Hopkins, Sony Pictures Television chairman, said on Wednesday.
The news comes just months after the 78-year-old television personality hinted he may be stepping away from his hosting duties on “Jeopardy!” in the near future. Trebek, who has hosted the show since 1984, told “OBJECTified” in July there was more than a 50/50 chance he’ll be leaving in 2020, when his contract is up.
