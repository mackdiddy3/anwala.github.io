More than a dozen shipments containing roughly 900 pounds of an “invasive” type of crab were uncovered by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials, the agency announced Wednesday.
Agriculture specialists with the CBP found the Chinese mitten crabs on Oct. 16 after spotting “x-ray anomalies” while inspecting Chinese cargo at an express consignment facility in Cincinnati, Ohio, the CBP said in a news release.
In accordance with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service protocol, none of the shipments were allowed into the country, the news release said.
“Our agriculture specialists and officers work closely with other federal agencies to protect our natural resources,” CBP Supervisory Agriculture Specialist Barbara Hassan said. “In this case, cooperative efforts with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) prevented the introduction of a highly invasive and destructive species into our ecosystem.”
"The crab spend most of their lives in freshwater, then migrate to salt water to reproduce. These massive migrations have clogged fish screens and hampered water delivery in Northern California, the agency explained. "The crabs burrow for protection, weakening levees and increasing erosion of banks. The crabs are know to eat Salmon, Trout and Sturgeon eggs, and may pose a serious threat to ecosystems and fisheries along the West Coast. They may pose a human health threat because they can carry the oriental lung fluke, and are considered a delicacy by many Asian populations, who eat them uncooked."
