The employee, who has not been identified, worked at Hamburger Mary’s Bar and Grille in Tampa's Ybor City neighborhood between Oct. 4 and Oct. 20, Florida Department of Health leaders in Hillsborough County said in a statement.
The health department is now urging anyone who visited the restaurant during that period to get a hepatitis A vaccine if they are not already vaccinated.
The “highly contagious” liver infection is caused by the hepatitis A virus, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The virus typically spreads when a person eats or drinks something “contaminated by small, undetected amounts of stool from an infected person,” the health agency said.
Those who contract hepatitis A — not to be confused with hepatitis B or C, which are caused by different viruses — may be sick for “several weeks" and usually fully recover, according to the CDC. It is rare to die from the illness, though hepatitis A can cause liver failure and death, typically in those who are 50 years of age or older.
The disease is preventable with a vaccine. Any unvaccinated residents who went to the restaurant between Oct. 4 and Oct. 20 can receive the shot at the Department of Health's Sulphur Springs location, officials said.
