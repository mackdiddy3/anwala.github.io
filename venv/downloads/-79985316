      Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi emerged in September 2014 to address ISIS supporters.
      <span class="copyright">(AP)</span></p></div></div><p>Naji claims to have first met the elusive leader in the U.S.-run Camp Bucca detention facility, in the south of Iraq, in 2004. The two were only together about a month, according to Naji, who&#xA0;described the ISIS commander as &#x201C;very quiet. Did not talk much, and would keep silent for long periods of time.&#x201D;</p><p>Baghdadi spent&#xA0;only 10 months behind bars. Naji was detained for three years, from 2004 to 2007.&#xA0;The two were both former al-Qaeda members.</p><p>Although born and raised in a Shia family, following the American invasion in 2003, Naji became more &#x201C;radicalized,&#x201D; and joined the Sunni terror group al Qaeda. He then called on fellow Iraqis to &#x201C;kill the Americans,&#x201D; and wage war against Iraqis who sided with them. That&apos;s what landed him in Bucca, security officials assert.</p><p>Naji was released and allegedly re-connected with Baghdadi &#x2013; who he said had changed into a suddenly devout and strict man &#x2013; and continued to recruit for Al Qaeda. That was before the shadowy leader later broke away, and formed ISIS.</p><p>Naji no longer identifies himself as an ISIS member. He is one of many who claim&#xA0;to have abandoned their pledges of allegiance to Baghdadi&#x2019;s insurgency, and&#xA0;have become &#x201C;depressed by the ISIS defeat,&#x201D; given they were promised &#x201C;the state of the Caliphate would never be defeated.&quot;</p><p>&#x201C;They didn&#x2019;t achieve their promises,&#x201D; Naji lamented. </p><p>A U.S military official told Fox News an estimated 1,800 fighters remain holed up in Syria, in pockets close to the Iraqi border. That&apos;s a far cry from the more than 35,000 who joined ISIS in Iraq and Syria during the peak years between 2014-2016.</p><p>As for Baghdadi himself, his location and disposition remain the source of much speculation. He has yet to be found, but all indications suggest he is still alive, and in hiding.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/a-look-inside-the-walls-of-a-prison-in-iraq-and-into-the-tortured-minds-of-female-isis-militants-held-there" target="_blank">A LOOK INSIDE THE WALLS OF A PRISON IN IRAQ, AND INTO THE TORTURED MINDS OF FEMALE ISIS MILITANTS HELD THERE</a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/from-jail-remorseful-ex-isis-fighter-warns-group-will-retool-and-return" target="_blank">FROM JAIL, REMORSEFUL EX-ISIS FIGHTER WARNS: GROUP WILL RETOOL AND RETURN</a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/the-lives-of-isis-wives-held-in-syria-infighting-jealousy-and-regrets" target="_blank">THE LIVES OF ISIS WIVES HELD IN SYRIA: INFIGHTING, JEALOUSY - AND REGRETS</a></p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/the-lives-of-isis-wives-held-in-syria-infighting-jealousy-and-regrets" target="_blank">thers joined &#x2013; and renounced their membership &#x2013; for reasons woven into the web of basic survival.</a></p><p>Other former ISIS fighters have renounced their membership in the group, many for reasons of basic survival.</p><p>Omar, 25-year-old from the Iraqi village of Dor Saladin, told Fox News he ended up in ISIS territory after fleeing an arranged marriage, and learning his wife &#x201C;had something wrong with her head.&#x201D; Believed to be responsible for the slaughter of some 70 Shia Muslims, Omar was told that if he wanted to stay in the area and protect his land, he needed to take up arms.</p><p>Living in fear ISIS leaders would turn their guns on him, he fled Mosul and attempted to &#x201C;blend in and find work&#x201D; in the northern Kurdish region of Iraq.&#xA0;But within weeks, he&#xA0;was identified and arrested by authorities.</p><p>Dawen, a then-19-year-old Kurdish fighter who went to Syria with a friend after being recruited by ISIS online, said he left after only a few weeks.

      <!----></p></div></div><p>Iraqi historian and researcher in extremism and security affairs, Hisham al Hashimi, laid out five central reasons why ISIS members leave the group.</p><p>&#x201C;First, the thoughts and ideologies change from when they first joined &#x2013; they start to see the ISIS thoughts are not correct. Second, they are not awarded the positions, and then are shocked when they don&#x2019;t get it,&#x201D; he said.</p><p>Third, ISIS leadership gave&#xA0;top positions to fighters from Saudi Arabia over Iraqis &#x2013; so that caused regional and nationalism issues.&#x201D; The fourth motive, according to Hashimi, is that members &#x201C;became depressed&#x201D; after realizing that they &#x201C;could not achieve the ambitious goals.&#x201D; The fifth and final was due to &#x201C;exhaustion&#x201D; from the continued, intense fighting.</p><p>Fadhel Abu Rageed, a Baghdad-based political and terrorism analyst, agreed internal squabbling, coupled with desolation, were the main reasons for ISIS defection.</p><p>&#x201C;Most of the foreign fighters especially feel broken after the Iraqi victory but cannot return to their home countries,&#x201D; Rageed noted. &#x201C;Most of the Iraqi fighters said they were made to feel like second-class fighters, while the foreigners were superior, and got to be leaders.&#x201D;</p><p>But there was one reason he was told by a now-detained ISIS member that surprised him the most.</p><p>&#x201C;One handsome Iraqi fighter said he left because he missed women while he was alone fighting in the deserts,&#x201D; Rageed said.</p><div source="" class="image-ct inline"><div class="m"><picture><source media="(max-width: 767px)" srcset="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1470/828/843faff3-isis.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x"><source media="(min-width: 767px)" srcset="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1862/1048/843faff3-isis.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1 2x"><img src="https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/843faff3-isis.jpg?ve=1&amp;tl=1" alt="ISIS fighter in what was once their &quot;caliphate&quot; capital of Raqqa, Syria"></picture></div><div class="caption"><p>
