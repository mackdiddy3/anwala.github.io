President Trump returns to the campaign trail with rallies in eight states before Election Day, including several states that he won in 2016 where Democrats are fighting to hold onto Senate seats.
A new round of Fox News battleground state polls proves we don’t call them battlegrounds for nothing. With six days until the election, three of the five U.S. Senate races could go either way -- and while Republicans hold leads in the other two, Democratic enthusiasm could still close the gap.
President Trump’s approval rating is at or above 50 percent in all. Yet in only two, North Dakota and Tennessee, does a GOP Senate candidate hit 50 percent support.
In two other states, Arizona and Missouri, the candidates are tied. The race in Indiana has reversed since early September -- however, one in five voters there who currently back a candidate say they may still change their mind.
No doubt, there will still be movement during the campaign’s final days.
Here are the state-by-state results, starting with Arizona:
Arizona
Democrat Kyrsten Sinema and Republican Martha McSally tie at 46 percent apiece among Arizona likely voters. Sinema was up by two points in early October and by three in September.
"Sinema's nearly two-to-one advantage among Hispanics means slightly higher Hispanic turnout than in the past could tip the race to the Democrat -- but the data doesn’t suggest a surge,” says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News surveys with Republican Daron Shaw.
The survey finds the number of Hispanic voters extremely interested in the election trails interest among non-Hispanic whites by 15 points.
Both Sinema (88 percent) and McSally supporters (88 percent) have a high degree of vote certainty, and equal numbers of Democrats (50 percent) and Republicans (50 percent) are extremely interested in the election.
Ninety-three percent of Democrats back Sinema, while 85 percent of Republicans support McSally. More Arizona voters identify as Republican than as Democrat by 10 points.
Five percent are still undecided about their vote in the Senate race.
The candidates are competing for the open seat of retiring Republican Sen. Jeff Flake.
Trump won Arizona by nearly four points. Currently, 52 percent of Arizona likely voters approve of the job he is doing, and 81 percent of Trump approvers are for McSally.
Incumbent Democrat Sen. Joe Donnelly bests Republican challenger Mike Braun by seven points among Indiana likely voters, 45-38 percent. His lead is at the poll’s margin of error. The race shifted since September when Braun was up by two points. In early October, Donnelly was up by two.
Donnelly’s edge comes in large part from greater party loyalty and higher interest in the election among Democrats. Fully 88 percent of Democrats back him vs. 80 percent of Republicans for Braun. In addition, nearly 1 in 10 Republicans go for Donnelly. Independents are about twice as likely to support the incumbent.
Nine percent of Indiana likely voters are undecided. Libertarian Lucy Breton takes five percent and that could be a wild card.
"Republican voters who flirt with Libertarian candidates tend to come home to the Republican candidate in the last few days,” says Shaw.
He adds, “Donnelly being under 50 percent bodes well for the less well-known challenger."
While Trump won Indiana by 19 points, more voters currently approve (50 percent) than disapprove (48 percent) of the job he is doing by just 2. In early September, more approved than disapproved by 10 (54-44 percent).
In a state that went for Trump by 36 points, Heitkamp is able to keep the race as close as it is thanks to greater support among Democrats.
Ninety-four percent of Democrats back Heitkamp. Support for Cramer among Republicans stands at 85 percent. The vote preference among independents goes in Heitkamp’s favor by a narrow three points.
Many more North Dakotans identify as Republican than as Democrat.
There is a 22-point gender gap, as Heitkamp is the choice for women by 1 point and men go for Cramer by 21.
By a 5-point margin, more Democrats (56 percent) than Republicans (51 percent) feel extremely interested in the election.
Among Cramer supporters, 92 percent feel sure they will vote for him, while 88 percent of Heitkamp supporters say the same.
Four percent are undecided about their Senate vote, and eight percent who currently support a candidate feel they could change their mind.
Heitkamp outperforms the other Democrat on the ballot this year. Mac Schneider is running against Republican Kelly Armstrong to take the state’s lone House seat vacated by Cramer. Armstrong leads by 55-33 percent.
Sixty-one percent of North Dakota likely voters approve of the job Trump is doing. He won 63 percent of the vote in 2016.
The Fox News Poll is conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R). The poll was conducted October 27-30, 2018 by telephone (landline and cellphone) with live interviewers among likely voters in Indiana (722), Missouri (741), North Dakota (789) and Tennessee (718). Results based on the full sample of likely voters in each state except North Dakota have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. ND is plus or minus three points. Registered voters were randomly selected from a statewide voter file (except in ND where all eligible voters were included), and respondents answered screening questions about their likelihood to vote in the November elections. For Arizona, it is October 27-29 and 643 likely voters, plus or minus 3.5 points.
