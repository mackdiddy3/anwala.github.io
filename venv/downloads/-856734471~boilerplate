California’s Medi-Cal program paid $4B to recipients who may have been ineligible, audit shows
An audit released Tuesday shows that the state of California spent $4 billion between 2014 and 2017 to pay for Medi-Cal coverage for recipients who might not have been eligible for the program, according to reports.
In one case, the report said, the state continued making payments into a resident’s health plan until August of this year – even though the resident died nearly five years ago. Payments to that resident’s plan totaled $383,000, the Times reported.
In a letter to the state Legislature that accompanied the audit, state auditor Elaine Howle wrote that “although Health Care Services has established a process for notifying counties of beneficiary records that require follow-up, gaps in this process allowed the problems we identified to persist.”

The audit found that 453,000 beneficiaries who were marked as eligible in the state records were not considered eligible at the county level, the report said – suggesting that those people may have died, moved or began making too much money to qualify for the program.
An email from the Associated Press, seeking comment from the Department of Health Care Services, which administers the Medi-Cal program, was not immediately returned.
