Bennett told BBC the paramedics checked his vitals in the terminal and cleared him to fly, but the WestJet flight crew refused to let him board. Bennett said he also had his doctor send an email ensuring his health for the flight, but was still not allowed back on the plane.
In a comment to Fox News, WestJet stood by their decision. Though the airline said it cannot comment extensively on individual situations, a spokesperson said Bennett was removed for being “under the influence of drugs,” not for sleeping, and said the accounts given by the crew “differ significantly” from what Bennett is alleging.
“When our crews observe a guest who is exhibiting signs of not being fit to fly, we will, out of an abundance of caution and in adherence with Transport Canada’s regulations remove the guest from the flight. These decisions are not taken lightly, but are made for the safety of the guest in question, other guests on the aircraft and our crews. We regret the inconvenience to our guest when situations like this occur,” the airline said to Fox News.
Bennett, who had booked an all-inclusive vacation in Cuba, said he had to spend $1,525 on a hotel room and tickets for his wife, his son and himself on another airline after WestJet told the group the earliest flight they could put them on was the following week.
"It threw a massive wrench into the happiness [of the trip]," he told the BBC, noting the change in flights cost the group two-days of their vacation they had already paid for.
Bennett is seeking compensation and further explanation from the airline, BBC reported.
