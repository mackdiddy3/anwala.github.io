Facebook fined just $645K for Cambridge Analytica scandal
Facebook has dodged a major bullet, and was fined just $645,000 for its Cambridge Analytica data scandal by the U.K.’s privacy watchdog, the maximum fine permissible and mere pennies for the social media behemoth that had $39.9 billion in revenue in 2017.
The U.K.’s Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) called the scandal a “serious breach of data protection” after confirming that the personal information of at least 1 million U.K. users was among the harvested data by Facebook, and consequently put at risk, as reported by Reuters. As a result, the ICO fined Facebook 500,000 pounds, equivalent to about $645,000.

Facebook told the WSJ that it was reviewing the ICO’s decision.
“While we respectfully disagree with some of their findings, we have said before that we should have done more to investigate claims about Cambridge Analytica and taken action in 2015,” a spokeswoman for the social network said.
