Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has slammed his tech saying they are turning their backs on the U.S. government for refusing to bid on Department of Defense contracts.
“One of the jobs of a senior leadership team is to make the right decision, even when it’s unpopular. If big tech companies are going to turn their back on the U.S. Department of Defense, this country is going to be in trouble,” Bezos said during a surprise appearance at the Wired 25 conference in San Francisco last week.
Hurd said it is imperative for the multibillion dollar cloud contract bid with the Pentagon to be open and fair.
“We think it’s important that, that bid, that contract be open, and that it be very fair and consider all of the alternatives,” he said.
