The candy company created a special candy converter machine that allows you to put the “disappointment” in and get a Reese’s peanut butter cup instead.
In a survey commissioned by Reese’s, 90 percent of Americans said they wish they could trade their unwanted Halloween candy, and four out of five people say they’d like to swap it for a Reese’s cup, according to a press release.
Unfortunately, there is a catch. The machine will only be available in New York City for five hours on Halloween night. It will be placed outside Washington Square Park from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m.
