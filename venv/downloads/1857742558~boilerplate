Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin blasted "Saturday Night Live" creator and producer Lorne Michaels after a comic on the show made fun of a Texas GOP congressional candidate who lost an eye serving in Afghanistan.
While Crenshaw said Monday on "Fox & Friends" that he would not demand an apology from Davidson or the show, Palin fired back at Michaels on Facebook.
"With all the grace I can muster I challenge you to wrestle back control of the show you’d shepherded, but allowed to be hijacked by some pretty sick - and boringly uncreative - young men," she said of Michaels, 73.
"You’re going down with the ship, Lorne. Sad to see your life’s work and worth crumble under the heartless no-talents."
Following Michael Cohen's public testimony before Congress, Judge Andrew Napolitano said President Trump's former attorney alleged no impeachable offenses, but he did give Democrats a "treasure trove of stuff" with which to torment the president.
