Suspicious packages addressed to Obama, Clinton, others: A full list of recipients
A timeline on a number of suspicious packages sent to to Democrats and media figures.
Sen. Cory Booker, Sen. Kamala Harris and former intel chief James Clapper became the latest targets Friday in a string of suspicious packages that have attempted to reach famous Democrats' doorsteps this week.
An explosive device was first discovered Monday inside a mailbox at liberal billionaire George Soros’ New York home. The Secret Service intercepted a suspicious package addressed to Hillary Clinton the next night. By Wednesday, at least five political figures were the aim of suspicious mail containing “potentially destructive devices” in New York, Washington, D.C., Florida and California. By Thursday, former Vice President Joe Biden and actor Robert De Niro were added to the list. As of Friday afternoon, at least 13 packages total have been discovered.
Federal authorities arrested the mail bombing suspect, identified as Cesar Sayoc, on Friday. The 56-year-old who lives in Aventura, Florida, was arrested at an auto parts store in nearby Plantation.
Read on for a look at what we know so far about all the packages that have been intercepted.
George Soros
On Monday, an explosive device was found in the mailbox at the Bedford, New York, home of the billionaire. Soros wasn't home at the time of the discovery.
"We are conducting an investigation at and around a residence in Bedford, NY," the FBI New York Twitter account shared at the time. "There is no threat to public safety, and we have no further comment at this time."
The bomb squad safely deactivated the device and turned over the investigation to the Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) Division of the FBI.
Hillary Clinton
A suspicious package intended for Clinton was “recovered” by the Secret Service in Westchester County, New York, late Tuesday, the federal law enforcement agency confirmed Wednesday morning.
The package was addressed to Bill and Hillary Clinton's home in Chappaqua, a Westchester hamlet.
The FBI New York Twitter account later said it was "aware of a suspicious package found in the vicinity of the Clinton residence in Chappaqua."
Barack Obama
The Secret Service revealed another package addressed to the Obamas’ Washington, D.C. home "was intercepted by Secret Service personnel” Wednesday morning.
This package — along with the one addressed to Clinton — was “immediately identified during routine mail screening procedures as potential explosive devices and were appropriately handled as such,” the Secret Service said in a statement. “Both packages were intercepted prior to being delivered to their intended location.”
The agency said both Clinton and Obama did not receive the packages and were never even within close proximity to them.
John Brennan
CNN employees were evacuated from their New York office on Wednesday due to a suspicious package at the Time Warner Center in Manhattan.
Alarms went off inside the bureau around 10 a.m. while anchors Poppy Harlow and Jim Sciutto were reporting live on suspected explosive devices sent to the famed politicians. CNN quickly cut to commercial as staff safely exited the building.
CNN said the package was addressed to ex-CIA director John Brennan.
Officers on the scene identified what "appeared to be a live explosive device" as well as an envelope containing white powder, which is now being investigated,” NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill said at a news conference.
Law enforcement sources told the network it was sent via courier and included "Time Warner (CNN)" as a listed recipient.
Eric Holder
The Sunrise, Fla., building housing the office of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, former Democratic Party chairwoman, was evacuated over a suspicious package Wednesday.
The package discovered at Wasserman Schultz's office, according to one law enforcement source, was mailed to ex-Attorney General Eric Holder under the wrong address — and therefore was shipped back to Wasserman Schultz' office due to the return label.
Maxine Waters
U.S. Capitol Police investigated two suspicious packages addressed to Maxine Waters, D-Calif., on Wednesday. The package is being held at the Capitol Hill mail screening facility in Maryland, a law enforcement source told Fox News.
“I have been informed by U.S. Capitol Police that my Washington, DC office was the target of a suspicious package that has been referred to the FBI,” Waters said in a statement. “[I'm[ appreciative of the law enforcement entities who intercepted the package and are investigating this matter. I unequivocally condemn any and all acts of violence and terror.”
Joe Biden
The FBI, New Castle County, Del., police and postal inspectors are investigating a package addressed to Biden, law enforcement officials confirmed to Fox News Thursday morning. The package was reportedly intercepted at a Delaware mail facility and appeared to be similar to several others this week.
Robert De Niro
The suspicious package addressed to De Niro was discovered Thursday in the mailroom of his production company, TriBeca Productions, a law enforcement source told Fox News. Security called police because the package looked similar to ones retrieved Wednesday, the law enforcement source said.
“A suspicious package was received. We called the police. They took it out and went through all safety procedures,” the Tribeca Film Center said in a statement. “It was addressed to Robert De Niro and is similar packaging to the others. It is an open investigation. Everyone is safe and the building is open.”
“I thank God no one's been hurt, and I thank the brave and resourceful security and law enforcement people for protecting us. There's something more powerful than bombs, and that's your vote. People MUST vote!” De Niro said in a statement Friday.
Cory Booker
The New Jersey Democrat's name was on a suspicious package found in Florida Friday, the FBI confirmed.
James Clapper
A package addressed to the former Director of National Intelligence was recovered Friday in New York, an NYPD source told Fox News.
Kamala Harris
A thirteenth package intended for Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., was intercepted in Sacramento Friday, a law enforcement source confirmed to Fox News.
Fox News’ Brooke Singman, Ryan Gaydos, John Roberts and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
