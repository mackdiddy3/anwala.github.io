The stock market fares fare the worst, in the short-term, when both the House and the Senate flip, dropping over 1 percent in the month following the election. Longer-term, however, they snap back, and on average have been up over 4 percent three months after the election and up 16.9 percent one year later, according to Dow Jones Market Data
