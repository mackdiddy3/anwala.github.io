A Texas man who told an undercover Florida sheriff's agent he wanted to "rape, kill and cannibalize" a child was arrested as part of a case that was described as "one of the most unusual and disgusting" ever seen.
Alexander Barter, 21, of Joaquin, posted an advertisement online that read, "I would really like to try necrophilia and cannibalism and see how it feels to take a life," Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey said during a news conference Tuesday.
Infamous Boston mobster James ‘Whitey’ Bulger was reportedly killed in a West Virginia prison facility the day he arrived.
Barter also allegedly told the agent: "I'm not into roleplaying. I want to actually rape, kill and cannibalize her. I am very serious about this. I live in the woods so I can make sure her body won't ever be found."
The agent traveled to Texas, and Barter was arrested on Oct. 19. He was taken into custody at his home, which "was quite deeply embedded in the woods."
During his arrest, Barter was found to have a knife and plastic bags on him "to take the body parts in," Ivey said. The sheriff added Barter "thanked" investigators for arresting him because "he was so committed to carrying" out his planned attack.
Barter is "one of the most sick, disgusting, demented people," Ivey told reporters.
