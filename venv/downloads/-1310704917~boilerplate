A Florida teenager, who allegedly strangled his mother to death last week over an argument about a bad grade, reportedly “showed no sign of remorse” and bragged about his attempt to cover up the crime, police said.
Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood described Gregory Ramos, 15, as one of the “top three sociopaths” he has ever encountered, according to ClickOrlando.com.
After strangling his 46-year-old mother, Gail Cleavenger, around midnight on Friday, Ramos loaded her body into a car and drove to a nearby church where he buried her body under a fire pit, police said.
