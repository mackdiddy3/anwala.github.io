Just one day before voters head to the polls, Sen. Lindsey Graham is optimistic about Republicans' chances in the midterm elections, saying, "I've never seen Republicans more united."
Graham (R-S.C.) is on the campaign trail with Vice President Mike Pence, making closing arguments to voters in Montana and South Dakota.
"I think we're going to kick butt in the Senate, and the House is too close to call," Graham said on "Fox & Friends" Monday.
He said the last 30 days have been a "nightmare" for Democratic candidates in states that went for Trump in 2016, pointing to the booming economy, the controversy surrounding the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and the migrant caravan that's headed for the U.S. border.
