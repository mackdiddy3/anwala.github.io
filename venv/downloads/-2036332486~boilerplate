Chicago has some 60 gangs, with several hundred factions within them, according to investigators. The city has seen more than 450 homicides this year, many of which police have linked to gangs.
Members of a Chicago street gang suspected of killing at least 11 people and terrorizing a South Side neighborhood for years were charged as part of a joint federal and state investigation announced Friday.
