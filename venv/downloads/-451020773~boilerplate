Elvis was allegedly having an affair with Moorer’s husband, 42-year-old Sidney Moorer — who investigators said plotted with his wife to abduct Elvis.
Prosecutors alleged that the Moorers drove around looking for Elvis the day she went missing and bought a pregnancy test, which they intended to use to determine if Elvis was pregnant with Sidney’s baby.
In February 2014, Sidney and Tammy Moorer were both arrested and charged with kidnapping and murder in connection with Elvis’ disappearance. The murder charges were later reportedly dropped.

The couple, according to prosecutors, then lured Elvis to a boat landing in Socastee around 3:30 a.m. — where phone records reportedly showed the 20-year-old called Sidney’s phone four times.
Roughly 15 minutes prior, Elvis and Sidney spoke on the phone for four minutes, according to The Sun Times. Tammy Moorer, however, reportedly testified she didn’t think much of the phone call, and argued that she and Sidney didn’t leave the house after that.
Days later, Horry County police found Elvis’ car at the boat landing.
In February 2014, Sidney and Tammy Moorer were both arrested and charged with kidnapping and murder in connection with Elvis’ disappearance. The murder charges were later dismissed, according to the newspaper.
