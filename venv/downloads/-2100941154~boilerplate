NJ man’s fall leads to $1M hospital lottery pool win
A New Jersey man who fell and broke his hip Tuesday while walking to buy a lottery ticket for this week’s historic Mega Millions jackpot turned his bad break into a $1-million consolation prize.
Earl Livingston, 87, was invited to join the hospital staff’s lottery pool with 141 other players after sharing his disappointment over getting injured before he could purchase his own ticket, WCAU-TV reported.
As luck would have it, the pool included a winning $1 million Mega Millions ticket.
