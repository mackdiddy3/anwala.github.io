If you're a voter in Georgia, you may soon get a knock at your door from Oprah Winfrey.
The talk show icon, who's been rumored as a presidential candidate in recent years, campaigned for Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams on Thursday.
Winfrey will reportedly knock on doors with Abrams in the Atlanta area and appear with her at two town hall events. Abrams is attempting to become the first black female governor in U.S. history, and is in a close race with Republican Brian Kemp.
The Abrams campaign said that Winfrey "will share why she believes Stacey Abrams is the best candidate to represent all of Georgia."
According to FOX Atlanta, Winfrey's visit will come on the same day that Vice President Mike Pence campaigns with Kemp.
Barack Obama is scheduled to campaign with Abrams Friday, while President Trump will hold a rally Sunday in Macon, Georgia, in support of Kemp. Actor Will Ferrell went door-to-door with Abrams last weekend.
Speaking to a crowd in Marietta, Winfrey emphasized that she's an independent and sought out Abrams after seeing her on television. She also highlighted the importance of positive messaging by candidates and for everyone to vote on Tuesday.
.@Oprah: "I've earned the right to think for myself and to vote for myself. And that's why I am a registered independentâ€” because I don't want any party and I don't want any kind of partisan influence telling me what decisions I get to make for myself." #Midterms2018pic.twitter.com/2iZt4tVm6w
