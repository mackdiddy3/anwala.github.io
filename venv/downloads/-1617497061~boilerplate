A Missouri father who served time in prison for violently shaking his 6-week-old son in 1998 was indicted on murder charges Tuesday, months after the son, who survived to age 20, died of injuries suffered in the attack two decades earlier.
Back in 1999, Olin Tannery, 39, of Excelsior Springs, pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree assault for shaking and squeezing Dominic Pittsenbarger, then age 6 weeks, in 1998, the Kansas City Star reported.
A newborn is rushed to the hospital after falling two feet off a bed. CT scans showed he fractured his skull and now suffers from severe brain damage and epilepsy. His doctors called his survival a miracle but expect him to have cerebral palsy when he is older.
But Pittsenbarger did survive — albeit with permanent brain damage — and was adopted by Wendell Pittsenbarger, whose last name he took.
The adopted boy used a wheelchair throughout his childhood and during high school, from which he graduated in 2017. He died in April from injuries he suffered when he was shaken two decades earlier.
"I love that boy and still miss him dearly. I think about him all of the time," his adoptive father told the news outlet.
Tannery was indicted on second-degree murder charges. Online reports indicate he remains in the custody of the Clay County Sheriff's Office and is scheduled to appear in court Friday.
