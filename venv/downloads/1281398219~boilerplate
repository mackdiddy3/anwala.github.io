Painting of Jesus miraculously survives inferno at historic Massachusetts church
Painting hanging in front entrance of First Baptist Church in Massachusetts survives after the building was destroyed in a fire.
A lightning strike reportedly ignited a massive inferno Tuesday night at the 150-year-old First Baptist Church in Wakefield, Massachusetts, destroying almost everything inside -- but amid the rubble, crews miraculously found one painting survived the hellish flames.
A painting depicting Jesus Christ – standing in a white robe with hands, bearing the marks of crucifixion, extended – survived nearly untouched with only a few drops of water on it. The painting hung just inside the church’s front doors.
“It’s a beautiful sign of hope and a reminder that Jesus is with us,” church member Maria Kakolowski told Boston 25. “I am personally just taking it as a sign and a reminder that the Jesus, the Christ that we serve is still alive and even though our church building is gone, our church is here. The God that we serve is still here.”
Crews began dismantling the remnants of the historic building Wednesday morning. There is no official cause of the fire, however, residents nearby said they saw lightning hit the church’s steeple.
The fire was reported after powerful thunderstorms rolled through the Greater Boston area.
In a statement, church officials expressed their gratitude no parishioners were hurt and thanked the fire department for battling the seven-alarm blaze.
“We know that we serve a God who specializes in restoring brokenness and who can bring beauty even from ashes,” they wrote. “So we move into the future with trust, hope, and gratitude.”
