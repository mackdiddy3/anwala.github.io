Homan said he has seen women raped, people tortured and migrants suffocated to death in the back of a trailer as a result of "criminal organizations" making money by transporting people over the border.
"When you have weak immigration laws, that's what happens. These people are at the mercy of criminal organizations," he explained.
The president said last week that if necessary, he'd call in the U.S. military to stop the thousands of migrants attempting to gain illegal entry into the country. Trump tweeted Monday morning that Mexican authorities cannot stop the caravan, claiming "Criminals and unknown Middle Easterners" are traveling in the caravan.
Sadly, it looks like Mexicoâ€™s Police and Military are unable to stop the Caravan heading to the Southern Border of the United States. Criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in. I have alerted Border Patrol and Military that this is a National Emergy. Must change laws!
Every time you see a Caravan, or people illegally coming, or attempting to come, into our Country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic Immigration Laws! Remember the Midterms! So unfair to those who come in legally.
Homan said he hopes American voters are "paying attention" to the Democrats' views on illegal immigration compared to President Trump.
"The president is 100 percent right on this point," he said.
"The vast majority of Democrats don't want to fix this system. They don't want to give this president a win on immigration, a win on the border issue. This is all about putting their political hatred of this president ahead of national security and public safety and ahead of the safety of the American patriots on the line who wear that uniform. It's disgusting," he said.
