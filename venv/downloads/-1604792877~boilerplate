Rep. Jim Jordan said voters have a very clear choice in next week's midterm elections: Democrats' rhetoric or President Trump's results.
"The left, they applaud Kaepernick when he disrespects the flag, they embrace Cuomo when he says America was never that great, they cheer on Maxine Waters when she says go and harass the president, go harass anyone who supports the president," Jordan (R-Ohio) said on "Your World" Friday.
He said voters just have to contrast that with numerous successes under President Trump's leadership, including the booming economy, the appointments of Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, progress on North Korean denuclearization, the decertification of the Iran nuclear deal, the relocation of the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and much more.
"You can just keep keep rattling it off. It is an amazing record under the leadership of President Trump in the last 21 months," Jordan said.
He said voters have a choice between that record or the "vision of Kaepernick, Cuomo and Waters," and he believes they will choose the former.
As for speculation that Republicans could lose the House, Jordan said there were two key promises that the Republican-controlled Congress failed to follow through on: repealing and replacing ObamaCare and building the border wall.
He said there is no chance of accomplishing either if Democrats control the levers of power.
"In fact, they want to go just the opposite direction. They want to socialize medicine more. They want to have an open border and get rid of ICE."
