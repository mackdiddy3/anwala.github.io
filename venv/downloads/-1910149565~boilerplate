“I think it’s impossible with James Avery being gone,” Ribeiro told “Chatter.” “Do we really want to see Will and Carlton in their, you know, 40s and 50s? I think people think they want to see that, but I don’t think people really want to see that.”
“Without him, everything that Will and Carlton did would mean nothing — it’s a bunch of kids acting stupid,” he continued. “There had to be jeopardy, and the way Uncle Phil was going to handle it was the other side of making what Will and Carlton did work. Without him, there is no ‘The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.’ I’m sure a [reboot] could happen, but I continue to say I think it’s very unlikely.”
