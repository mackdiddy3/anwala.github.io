9/11 terrorist gets hero's welcome back home after serving just 15 years for attacks
Mounir el-Motassadeq, one of the only two people who has been tried and sentenced in connection to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks is a free man again. After being deported by Germany he will be heading back to his native Morocco.
A terrorist jailed over the September 11 attacks has been mobbed by supporters back home in Morocco after being freed early.
Mounir el Motassadeq was sentenced to just 15 years behind bars for accessory to murder in 2006.
He received credit for time served after his initial arrest in 2001 â€” and was freed shortly before finishing even that stretch to be deported to his homeland.
