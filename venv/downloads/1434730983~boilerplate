The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has asked chicken owners to avoid committing a party fowl this Halloween by dressing up their domestic livestock.
The Atlanta-based CDC said costumed chickens out for a night of trick-or-treating run the risk of infecting people with a particular potent strain of salmonella.
So far, at least 92 people in 29 states have been infected with a strain of multidrug-resistant salmonella after coming into contact with raw chicken products. Twenty-one of the sick patients have been hospitalized.
Despite the warning, some chicken owners said they aren’t about to leave their little nuggets at home on the big night.
