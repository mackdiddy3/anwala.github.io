The likelihood of ever becoming a franchisee, however, is slim. Chick-fil-A receives nearly 40,000 franchisee inquires annually and only ends up approving roughly 100 applications, according to the Washington Post.
After making the initial online application, Chick-fil-A conducts in person and video interviews with the top candidates, assessing their business acumen and their suitability for the position. In some instances, the company may even contact friends, family and former business partners, according to Business Insider.
The steep competition is likely driven by Chick-fil-A's relatively miniscule cost to open a franchise. While franchisees of other prominent fast food restaurants should expect to spend millions of dollars, Chick-fil-A only requires its franchisees to spend $10,000.
