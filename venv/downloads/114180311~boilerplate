Though the wildly high stakes of the 2018 midterm elections will hopefully be motivation enough to spur American voters to cast their ballots today, various culinary chains across the country are rewarding voters with free and discounted food.
As noted by Nation's Restaurant News, while offering free food (or any kind of free goods) to incentivize voting in political elections is illegal, many businesses swerve potential repercussions by extending Election Day promotions to any customers who request them, not just those sporting an “I Voted” sticker.
"It is illegal in elections when federal candidates are on the ballot to offer free stuff (including free food or drink) to people upon proof of voting," UC Irvine law professor Rick Hasen told the outlet earlier this month.
