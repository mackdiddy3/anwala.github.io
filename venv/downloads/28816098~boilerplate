Martha MacCallum said that a recent survey showed that tens of millions of people from Central America and the Caribbean would emigrate to America if possible.
She pressed Ramos on that figure, and how such numbers of migrants could affect America. She said that there are cases of migrants who have been deported previously who are trying to use the caravan's strength in numbers to make it into America again.
Ramos, who was born in Mexico but is an American citizen, said that he is not for open U.S. borders, but added that Trump's immigration policies are "a complete failure."
"There's no invasion here," blasting the "optics" of the caravan as being misconstrued.
Tomi Lahren joined Steve Doocy on "Fox & Friends" Thursday to preview the new episode of Fox Nation's "No Interruption," which investigates the murder of an American man in a popular tourist destination in Mexico.
