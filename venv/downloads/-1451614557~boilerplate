In her Opening Statement, Judge Jeanine Pirro echoed President Trump's idea of deploying the U.S. military to close the southern border.
The president on Thursday tweeted the possibility and said it would be done if Mexican officials refuse to stop the northern progress of a massive migrant caravan.
....In addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught - and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!..
Pirro questioned why illegal immigrants from Central America and Mexico are seeking refuge in the United States, while others from poverty-stricken parts of the world aren't.
"Why? Because they can," she said. "Because no one has told them they can't. Because no one has stopped them."
If the left has its way, she said, "rogue cities" would exist throughout the country.
Pirro said that the "bozos" on the left advocate for open borders to allow a "mob" of illegal immigrants to vote Democrat.
Congress, she added, needs to stop the flow of U.S. foreign aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
"I am sick and tired of people telling us to have a heart," she said. "We have a heart. We are the most generous country in the world."
She also had a message for those attempting to enter the United States illegally.
"When you cross the border into these United States illegally, expect to be arrested. You do not have the right to come here. We did not invite you here. You cannot stay here. And on your way out, you can tell the Democrats, George Soros and the angry mob that's coming here [that] you either come the right way like everyone else or be ready to face the military and a one-way ticket back to where you came from."
