Michael Eisenberg told CBS 2 Pittsburgh security was a "major concern" when he was president, and that one of the synagogue's maintenance workers was able to escape because the building's exit doors were working effectively.
"He was able to get out of the building ... because these exit doors were working well," he said. "I just can't tell you how thankful I am just to do that one task that Homeland Security told us to do."
President Trump tweeted about the incident, saying to beware of the active shooter.
Watching the events unfolding in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Law enforcement on the scene. People in Squirrel Hill area should remain sheltered. Looks like multiple fatalities. Beware of active shooter. God Bless All!
