‘Price is Right’ icon Bob Barker rushed to hospital: report
"Price is Right" icon Bob Barker was reportedly rushed to the hospital on Monday, according to TMZ.
Bob Barker was rushed to a hospital in California with back trouble Monday, according to a report.
Barker's manager told TMZ that the former "Price is Right" host, 94, woke up in the morning with a major flare in back pain, which prompted his family to call the paramedics to take him to the hospital.
The Los Angeles Fire Department arrived at Barker's Hollywood Hills home around 1 p.m., and immediately took him to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, TMZ added. Photos showed the TV legend on a stretcher.
“It was painful and difficult to get him in a private vehicle. We decided it was easier and better for him," the manager explained to People, noting that Barker is "awake and alert."
