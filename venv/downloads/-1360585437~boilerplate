The plane vanished from radar around 11:30 a.m. and disappeared around 110 miles east of Charleston, the U.S. Coast Guard said. The aircraft reported "an in-flight emergency, lost contact on radar and notified the [Air Force Rescue Coordination Center.]
The Coast Guard said the search would continue through Thursday night by ship, while aircraft would rejoin the search at first light Friday morning.
The FAA will not confirm the aircraft's registration or ownership until it is located, WHNS-TV reported.
It wasn't immediately known how many passengers or crew were onboard the plane.
Several military aircraft and ships aided in the initial search Thursday.
