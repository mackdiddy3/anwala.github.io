Indonesian military officials say the Lion Air jet that crashed Monday minutes after takeoff may have been found in the Java Sea.
Hadi Tjahjanto, the armed forces chief, said a search and rescue team had identified the possible seabed location of the jet.
"Based on the presentation of the head of the National Search and Rescue Agency, the coordinates of the suspected body of the aircraft have been found. We will send a team there to confirm," Tjahjanto said.
Navy officer Harris Djoko Nugroho said the 72-foot long object is at a depth of 105 feet. He said divers will be deployed after side-scan sonar has produced more detailed images.
The rescue team had previously found debris and some human remains from the wreckage but not the main fuselage and the black boxes. Officials said the non-stop search effort has sent 48 body bags containing human remains to police identification experts.
