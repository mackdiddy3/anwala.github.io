Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said it was "disgraceful" for Rep. Maxine Waters to call on President Trump to "take responsibility" for the slew of package bombs sent to prominent Democrats.
Cesar Sayoc, a 56-year-old Trump supporter who lived in Aventura, Florida, was taken into custody Friday and charged with five federal crimes for allegedly mailing crude bombs to Waters, former President Obama, Bill and Hillary Clinton and others.
In an interview with Blavity Wednesday, Waters (D-Calif.) called out Trump for his rhetoric, claiming he "really does do a lot to promote violence."
“I think the president of the United States should take responsibility for the kind of violence that we’re seeing for the first time in different ways,” Waters said. “I think the president of the United States has been dog whistling to his constituency … and I think that they’re acting out, but they believe the president wants them to do and the way that he wants them to act.”
Bondi -- who was harassed and heckled by protesters at a movie theater earlier this year -- pointed out that Waters infamously called on her supporters to confront members of the Trump administration in public.
"It was the Maxine Waters rhetoric. These people were, verbatim, repeating the Maxine Waters talking points, screaming in my face, stopping me," Bondi said, noting that White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen were also harassed in public by protesters around the same time.
"And now for Maxine Waters to ... blame it on the president is disgraceful. The first thing President Trump did was come out and condemn these actions," Bondi said.
Juan Williams said Trump cannot be directly blamed for the package bombs, but it's "impossible" to ignore that his rhetoric has contributed to the tense political environment.
"He has made a habit of demeaning and dehumanizing his political opponents," Williams said.
