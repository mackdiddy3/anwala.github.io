Trump administration says new sanctions targeting Iran's economy are the toughest ever against the regime; Rich Edson reports from the State Department.
President Donald Trump has landed himself in hot water with the cast of "Game of Thrones" after sharing a "GOT"-inspired meme advocating for Iran sanctions.
On Friday afternoon, the president shared a photo on his Twitter account featuring himself Photoshopped into a meme inspired by the HBO series, which read, "Sanctions are coming. November 5." The meme was meant to be a play on the famous "GOT" phrase "Winter is coming."
But some of the HBO cast members, as well as the author of the books series, weren't fans of the joke.
"GOT" star Maisie Williams, who is known on the show for her role as Arya Stark, retweeted the image and said: "Not today."
Actress Sophie Turner, who plays Sansa Stark on the show, commented on Trump's tweet with a simple, "Ew."
HBO poked fun at the president tweeting a response to his image and said, "How do you say trademark misuse in Dothraki?" Dothraki is the language spoken by the tribe of nomadic warriors on the series.
The network further slammed Trump in a statement to CNN saying that they would rather the president not associate himself with their award-winning series.
"We were not aware of this messaging and would prefer our trademark not be misappropriated for political purposes," the network's statement said.
Even George R.R. Martin, whose "A Song of Ice and Fire" series served as the inspiration for the popular HBO show, tweeted a message in response to Trump's post and said: "Fear cuts deeper than swords." The author also took the time to encourage people to vote in the midterm elections, adding: "Vote. Tuesday the 6th."
But this isn't the first time Martin has spoken out against Trump.
In an October interview with the New York Times, the 70-year-old compared the president to the show's tyrannical teenage character, King Joffrey, and said, "They have the same amount of emotional maturity."
