Vice President Mike Pence responded to Oprah Winfrey and channeled his inner "Anchorman" while campaigning for Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp in Georgia.
"This ain't Hollywood!" said Pence Thursday at a rally in Savannah, joking "I'm kind of a big deal, too," a nod to Ferrell's 2004 hit movie in which he played news anchor Ron Burgundy.
Earlier in the day, Winfrey delivered a stump speech for Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is looking to become the nation's first black female governor.
The talk show icon, who's been rumored as a presidential candidate in recent years, spoke at an event in Marietta with Abrams, who is in a close race with Kemp. She emphasized that she's an independent and sought out Abrams after seeing her on television.
Winfrey also highlighted the importance of positive messaging by candidates and for everyone to vote on Tuesday.
"I want to make it very clear to all the press, to everybody: I'm not here because I'm making some grandstand because I'm thinking about running myself. I don't want to run, OK? ... I'm not trying to test any waters," she said, shaking her head as some in the crowd protested for her to reconsider.
Pence said Abrams' campaign is "bankrolled by Hollywood liberals," and that Georgians want a governor who will put the state and its values first.
Barack Obama is scheduled to campaign for Abrams Friday, while President Trump will hold a rally in Macon on Sunday.
