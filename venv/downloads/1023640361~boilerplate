Dog in Oklahoma pretends to be stray to get free McDonald’s hamburgers, owner says
New Australian research looked at the health outcomes for Labradors, one of the world’s most popular canine breeds, and found that chocolate labs live significantly shorter lives than their black and yellow cousins.
A dog in Oklahoma has become a viral sensation after her owner caught her sneaking off to a local McDonald’s to score free hamburgers.
Earlier this week, Betsy Reyes wrote on Facebook her dog, Princess, had been leaving her home at night and heading to the fast food restaurant. She acts "like she’s a stray so people will feel bad for her & feed her burgers,” Reyes wrote in the post, which had more than 290,000 reactions and 270,000 shares as of Thursday afternoon.

"If you see my dog @ the McDonald's on shields, quit feeding her fat a-- bc she don't know how to act & be leaving the house all the time to go walking to McDonald's at night. She's not even a stray dog," Reyes, of Oklahoma City, explained.
On Monday, Reyes decided to follow the pup to the McDonald’s, where she caught Princess approaching a stranger’s car and begging the driver for food, a video shows.
