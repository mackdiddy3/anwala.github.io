Politicians react to suspicious packages sent to Obama, Clinton, CNN
Metal pipe found in mailroom at CNN. David Lee Miller reports from New York City.
The suspicious packages sent to the homes of former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and to the Time Warner Center in New York, where CNN is located, on Wednesday elicited reactions from politicians across the aisle, many of whom condemned the incidents.
The packages sent to Obama and Clinton were identified by Secret Service officials as "potential explosive devices." They arrived after an explosive device was found at billionaire George Soros' home in Bedford, New York earlier this week. It's not immediately clear if the incidents are related.
Read on for a look at what politicians are saying.

Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in an emailed statement.

Pascrell went on to criticize President Trump, writing, "For years now, Donald Trump has been calling for the jailing of his critics and has lauded violence against journalists. The revolting ‘Lock Her Up’ chants have stoked the flames of hate. The slurs against George Soros that Republicans continue to invoke are dredged up from centuries of nauseating anti-Semitism."
"They have helped create an environment that has fostered all this. They must stop trying to divide America and help us lower the national temperature.

Rubio later added: "An attack on an American who happens to be a Democrat, Republican or Independent is an attack on America. The terrorist behind this will soon find out that while a free people have politics that are conflictive,if you try to kill any of us you will have to face all of us."
