The $1.6 billion prize reflects the annuity option, paid over 29 years. The cash option, which nearly all winners take, was estimated to be $913 million.

It costs $2 to play the game, but the odds of matching all six numbers and taking home the grand prize is a dismal 1 in 302.5 million.
Mega Millions is played in 44 states as well as Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
While the spotlight has mostly been on the Mega Millions game, the Powerball jackpot has also been surging. The prize is estimated to be worth $620 million in Wednesday's drawing, one of the largest in the Powerball's history.
