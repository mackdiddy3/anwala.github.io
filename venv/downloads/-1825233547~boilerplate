Hollywood Nation: Matthew McConaughey surprises a group of real-life heroes in Houston to celebrate National First Responders Day; Grammy winner Ed Sheeran donates six pairs of his boxers to be auctioned off in a fundraisers for a British hospice.
Matthew McConaughey visited Houston, Texas, on Sunday to honor those who risked their lives during Hurricane Harvey.
McConaughey, who is Wild Turkey's creative director, explained in a Facebook video that he and the bourbon brand were traveling to meet different first responders — more than a year after Harvey wreaked havoc on Houston in August 2017.
“Basically today is about saying thank you to these people that were on the front line and got out there to rescue people first,” the Texas native said.
The star surprised first responders and delivered them "delicious turkey feasts" as a way of showing appreciation, Wild Turkey explained in a news release. The bourbon brand said McConaughey and Master Distiller Eddie Russell made multiple stops in the city.
“Matthew and Eddie began the day at Houston Fire Station 26, followed by visits to City Hall to meet with Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, the Police Department, Houston Emergency 911 Call Center, and Ben Taub Hospital Emergency Center,” Wild Turkey announced.
“Matthew @McConaughey teamed up with @WildTurkey to give back to Houston’s heroes,” Turner tweeted. “Honored to welcome him to our city and thank him for spending time and recognizing our @houstonpolice, @HoustonFire, and 911 dispatchers for their service.”
