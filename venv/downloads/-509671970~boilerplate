The team is gearing up for a parade in Beantown on Wednesday after defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series.
The question of whether professional teams will make the customary visit has been a contentious one since Trump's Jan. 2017 inauguration. Last year's champions, the Houston Astros, visited the White House, with two players deciding to skip the trip.
The Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles and back-to-back NBA champion Golden State Warriors did not visit the White House this year. The Warriors were disinvited by Trump in Sept. 2017 after star guard Stephen Curry said he did not want to go.
The Eagles were also disinvited by Trump after most of the team announced they would not attend.
The Philadelphia Eagles Football Team was invited to the White House. Unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event. Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry!
