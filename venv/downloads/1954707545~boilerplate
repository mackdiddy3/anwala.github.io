There is a hurricane warning from San Blas to Mazatlan, the latter of which is a tourist resort of about 500,000 people with many U.S. and Canadian expatriates.
“Little change in strength is expected before Willa crosses the coast of Mexico,” the advisory said. “Very rapid weakening is expected after landfall, and Willa is expected to dissipate over northern Mexico on Wednesday.”
What else should I know?
The areas from Playa Perula to San Blas and north of Mazatlan to Bahia Tempehuaya are subject to tropical storm warnings, the NHC said.
