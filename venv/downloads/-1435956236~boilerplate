“People are amazed. It’s not every day that you get to see it and I was able to tape it ... it’s a beauty to see,” the Timmins resident said.
Though their striking color may have caused some to think these creatures were albino, the news station reported they were not. Rather, these white moose — sometimes called "ghost" or "spirit" moose — are a snowy white due to the Armstrong White Gene Strain, a recessive gene which causes the color, according to Tourism Northern Ontario.
Northern Ontario residents or tourists can typically spot white moose along highway 101 — the same highway where Leblanc captured the video — between Foleyet and Timmins, according to Tourism Northern Ontario.
As of Wednesday morning, Leblanc’s video had more 3 million views and 80,000 shares.
