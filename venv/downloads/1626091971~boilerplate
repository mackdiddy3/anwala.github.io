Last night during the World Series opening game, Betts stole second base from the Los Angeles Dodgers, fulfilling Taco Bell’s “Steal a base, Steal a taco” promotion, which promises one free Dorito’s Locos Taco anytime a player steals a base during the seven-game series.
The fast food mega chain has been running the World Series deal for the past 11 years. Last night Betts became the seventh player to steal a base during the series since the restaurant started the campaign.
Those interested in procuring their free Doritos Locos Tacos can visit a participating Taco Bell on November 1 between 2 - 6 pm. Or print out a free taco voucher online and cash it in at any store throughout the day.
