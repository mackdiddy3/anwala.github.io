Adam Hertzman, marketing director for the federation, told Fox News its website has received 3,871 donations totaling more than $528,000 as of Wednesday night. If the group includes larger gifts — such as corporate donations and gifts from other foundations — the fund has raised “well, well over” $1 million, he said.
