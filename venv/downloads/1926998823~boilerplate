The driver “activated the buses’ stop arm and exterior lighting, as he was picking up children from the west side of the road,” the news release said. “As children crossed the road, to get on the bus, four children were allegedly hit by a southbound 2017 Toyota Tacoma, driven by Alyssa Shepherd, 24.”
The fourth child, 11-year-old Maverik Lowe, was wounded in the incident and airlifted to a hospital, police said. The suspected driver, Shepherd, was arrested Tuesday afternoon.
“My two nephews and my niece were taken from me because somebody didn’t pay attention,” Ingle told RTV 6 ABC.
The twin boys had a tendency to be a little shy, Ingle said. But “once you got past the shyness, the two boys were a life spark,” he added.
"She's what you'd want in a child," Ingle said of his niece.
He also praised their big sister as being goal-driven and “the kindest child.”
“She’s what you’d want in a child,” he told the outlet.
Stahl also seemingly attempted to protect her brothers in the moments before the crash, Ingle said.
“She was holding their hand when they were hit and it looks like she tried to shield them a little bit,” Ingle told RTV 6 ABC of his niece. “She had a split second to think of what to do, she chose to shield her brothers with that split second.”
