Graham told Sean Hannity Tuesday night that he believes the treatment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh before his confirmation and the approaching migrant caravan have united and energized the party's voters.
"Kavanaugh and the caravan: if you're a Republican and you're not excited about voting, you're legally dead," he joked.
He said all Republicans, whether they support President Trump or not, were angry about the way sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh played out in the Senate.
"It was an assault on everything we hold near and dear. ... Between the Kavanaugh debacle, a despicable character assassination and a caravan trying to overrun our borders, it's been a nightmare for red state Democrats."
Graham is on a swing through battleground states ahead of the election, appearing alongside Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, who is running for governor.
Following Michael Cohen's public testimony before Congress, Judge Andrew Napolitano said President Trump's former attorney alleged no impeachable offenses, but he did give Democrats a "treasure trove of stuff" with which to torment the president.
