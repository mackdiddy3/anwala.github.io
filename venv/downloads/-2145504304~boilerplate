Second police officer dies after South Carolina ambush attack
Deputy Farrah B. Turner died Monday, becoming the second officer to die in an ambush earlier this month.
Authorities on Monday said a second South Carolina police officer died from her injuries suffered in an ambush attack at the hands of an ex-Army sharpshooter earlier this month.
Florence County Sheriff Kenney Boone said Deputy Farrah B. Turner died Monday. She had been hospitalized since the attack.
Boone said in a statement that Turner "was the ultimate professional, excelling at everything she did. She dedicated her life to serving the victims of the worst crimes imaginable."
Turner was among seven law enforcement officers shot by 74--year--old Frederick Hopkins. They say the decorated Vietnam War opened fire without warning when officers arrived at his home Oct. 5 to speak with his son about a sex assault investigation.
