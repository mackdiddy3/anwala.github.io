President Donald Trump on Friday called for unity after the arrest of a suspect in the string of mail bombs sent to prominent Democrats.
Cesar Sayoc, of Aventura, Florida, has been arrested in connection with the rash of suspicious packages. A law enforcement source told Fox News that he is a white male in his 50s, who used to live in New York and had prior arrests for terroristic threats.
"I am pleased to inform you that law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody," Trump said to cheers at the 2018 Young Black Leadership Summit at the White House.
