Michael Cohen on Trump: “He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat”
Former Trump attorney/fixer Michael Cohen testifies — publicly — before the House Oversight and Reform Committee beginning at 10:00 am ET, and here are excerpts of Cohen’s opening remarks:
“Never in a million years did I imagine, when I accepted a job in 2007 to work for Donald Trump, that he would one day run for President, launch a campaign on a platform of hate and intolerance, and actually win. I regret the day I said “yes” to Mr. Trump. I regret all the help and support I gave him along the way.”
“I am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat.”
He will tell the committee that he's providing it a “copy of a check Mr. Trump wrote from his personal bank account – after he became president - to reimburse me for the hush money payments I made to cover up his affair with an adult film star and prevent damage to his campaign.”
“Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That’s not how he operates. In conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there’s no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie.”
“There were at least a half-dozen times between the Iowa Caucus in January 2016 and the end of June when he would ask me ‘How’s it going in Russia?’ – referring to the Moscow Tower project.”
“Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it. He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project.”
“In July 2016, days before the Democratic convention, I was in Mr. Trump’s office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone. Mr. Trump put Mr. Stone on the speakerphone. Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign.”
Lightfoot, Preckwinkle advance to runoff in Chicago
Out of 14 total candidates for Chicago mayor, the two who advance to an April 2 runoff are two African-American women: former federal prosecutor Lori Lightfoot and Cook County Board of Commissioners President Toni Preckwinkle.
And no candidate cracked 20 percent of the vote. Lightfoot got 17.5 percent, while Preckwinkle got 16.0 percent, per the Chicago Tribune. William Daley, who served as Commerce secretary under Bill Clinton and White House chief of staff under Barack Obama, finished third with 14.8 percent.
2020 Vision: Biden’s still making up his mind
“Joe Biden said Tuesday that he’s now ‘certain’ his family is prepared for a grueling political fight, but cautioned that a final decision about 2020 will come down to whether he feels confident he can secure the Democratic nomination,” NBC’s Mike Memoli writes.
“‘I don’t want this to be a fool’s errand,’ Biden said. ‘I want to be sure that if we do this, and we’re very close to getting to a decision, that I am fully prepared to do it.’”
More: “‘I think we can [win the nomination.] I think that’s where we are. But there’s still a couple hurdles to go through to make sure we have this all in place.’”

That’s Republican Sen. John Cornyn’s approval rating in his home state of Texas, according to a new Quinnipiac poll. Another quarter of Texans disapprove of Cornyn’s performance, putting his NET approval at +17.
One person who’s probably paying attention to those numbers? Democrat Beto O’Rourke, who’s being encouraged to run for either president of the United States or to run against Cornyn in 2020.
Cornyn is less well known than Ted Cruz, who just barely beat O’Rourke in November. (About 31 percent of Texans don’t have an opinion of Cornyn, while only nine percent say the same for Cruz.)
