A Florida man killed his live-in girlfriend and her son Sunday night after an argument over watching a football game on the television, court documents showed.
Tyrone Terell Johnson, 42, was arrested Sunday night and faces several charges -- including murder and aggravated child abuse -- in the death of his girlfriend and her 10-year-old son, neither of who were not identified. Johnson ended up in handcuffs after calling 911 just before 7 p.m. Sunday to report he was being attacked inside a Tampa apartment, FOX13 Tampa reported.
Johnson told Hillsborough County deputies that he and his girlfriend got into a verbal argument over changing the channel to watch a football game and the incident escalated, court documents stated. He then began packing his belongings in the master bedroom when his girlfriend allegedly walked in and began “verbally berating” him.
“(She) allegedly was ‘tussling’ at (Johnson's) back. (He) claimed (she) pushed him off of his ‘knee roller’ and he sat down on the floor next to the bed,” the documents stated.
The boy, who is not Johnson’s son, then accused the 42-year-old of hitting his mother, FOX13 reported.
Johnson allegedly pushed the child, grabbed his handgun and began firing at his live-in girlfriend while she was holding a PlayStation. He shot and killed the child, who had walked out, when the boy came back into the bedroom, police said.
Investigators also found blood and signs that shots were fired inside the child’s bedroom.
Johnson reportedly had been living with the woman and her son for about a year before the deadly incident.
