Virginia school cafeteria manager uses bananas to empower kids
Cafeteria manager Stacey Truman started bringing the "talking bananas" to school to brighten up the students' days.
A cafeteria manager is changing her students' lives for the better at an elementary school in Virginia Beach, Va., writing empowering and uplifting messages on bananas being offered in the school cafeteria.
Stacey Truman has held the position at Kingston Elementary School for nine years, but recently decided to start making the “talking bananas,” as the kids call them, to encourage the students.
Truman’s sweet gesture did not just have an impact on the children, however. School principal Sharon Shewbridge saw the bananas and posted a picture of the fruit on Twitter, where it started receiving viral attention.
“[Truman]’s almost embarrassed about all the attention,” Shewbridge tells Yahoo Lifestyle. “She just wanted it to be anonymous. But I said this is so simple and amazing — and it has such an impact on kids.”
“It’s simple, but these words can help them be more courageous and realize that they are good enough,” Shewbridge added to Yahoo. “I hope that other schools see it’s an easy way to get a kind message to kids.”
