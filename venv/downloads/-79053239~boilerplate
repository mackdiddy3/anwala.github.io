House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi hinted at using subpoena power to negotiate with President Trump if Democrats retake the House in the midterm elections.
Pelosi (D-Calif.) made the remark during CNN's "Citizen" forum in New York City and said that subpoena power is "a great arrow to have in your quiver in terms of negotiating on other subjects."
"To use it, or not to use it," she said.
Peloisi added that Democrats would "exercise oversight" over government agencies, something the current administration has "walked away" from.
By saying she’s willing to use subpoena power as a negotiating chip for other issues, Nancy Pelosi is admitting what we’ve known all along – that the countless investigations Democrats are threatening to launch are baseless and totally political. pic.twitter.com/pIogNaNmFz
