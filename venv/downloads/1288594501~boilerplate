America's most expensive house listed for $245M
A 25,000-square-foot home located in Bel Air is up for sale. It is the most expensive house in America
The West Coast really is the best coast — especially when it comes to real estate priced in the nine-figure range.
In the Bel Air enclave of Los Angeles, the 10-plus-acre estate of late billionaire A. Jerrold Perenchio — who died in 2017 at 86, and was at one time the chairman and CEO of Spanish-language network Univision — has hit the market for a sky-high $245 million.
Not only does that mighty price make it the most expensive home for sale in the City of Angels, but it also makes the property take the crown for the priciest home for sale in America, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Last year, the Times notes, Perenchio’s estate — which he had owned since 1986 — was quietly shopped off-market for a nine-figure asking price.
Should Perenchio’s former pad sell for its asking price, or even for half off, it would also crush the sales record for Los Angeles County.
Now on the open market, this property joins nearly 10 LA homes that have listed in recent years for over $100 million. One of them, just a minute away by car, is luxury developer Bruce Makowsky’s 38,000-square-foot spec home, which asks $188 million. That new-construction mansion originally hit the market in 2017 for $250 million, as The Post reported, which made it the nation’s priciest at the time.
Should Perenchio’s former pad sell for its asking price, or even for half off, it would also crush the sales record for Los Angeles County. That’s now held by natural gas billionaire Michael Smith, who bought a Malibu beach house for $110 million in April from Hard Rock Cafe founder Peter Morton.
Fans of “The Beverly Hillbillies” may recognize Perenchio’s main residence, which appeared in the credits of the popular sitcom.
The sprawling, 25,000-square-foot, Sumner Spaulding-designed mansion dates to the 1930s, when it was built for Lynn Atkinson, a civil engineer. Since renovated and restored by designer Henri Samuel, the French neoclassical-style property features a paneled dining room, a 12,000-bottle wine cellar and formal rooms.
