“Three of these Lunar Module-5 Identification Plates were flown to the moon on Apollo 11 and returned to Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp,” Heritage Auctions explained. “They then mounted each ID plate on a wall plaque and one was presented to each crewmember.”
“The entire total sale brought more than $7.4 million,” Eric Bradley, the director of public relations for Heritage Auctions, told Fox News in an email. “Just the Armstrong items alone brought more than $5.2 million.”
