Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is scheduled for a closed-door interview with House lawmakers on Wednesday, but Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton is not a fan of the interview format.
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) said he wants to know about reports that Rosenstein floated wearing a wire during a meeting with President Trump, and that he suggested invoking the 25th Amendment to replace Trump.
Goodlatte noted the interview of Rosenstein will be held in a secure room, and that a transcript will be released after the intelligence community reviews it for classified information.
The secure room allows “the opportunity to ask any question that needs to be asked, and not have concern about it not being in a classified setting and not be concerned about leaks, which have been a serious problem with our investigation,” Goodlatte added.
Fitton, however, is taking issue with the fact that only the two Republican chairmen and top two Democrats on the House Judiciary and Oversight committees are set to interview Rosenstein.
"This is going to be secret testimony. And if you're trying to prevent facts from getting out to the public, this is the way to do it," Fitton said on "America's Newsroom" Tuesday, wondering why a Republican-controlled House would not want more Republican lawmakers involved in the questioning.
He said the Justice Department doesn't want to answer questions from Congress, and lawmakers are being "way too deferential."
"I don't trust that the information will get out to the American people in a timely way and I don't trust that, generally speaking, members of Congress and congressional committees to be doing these types of investigations behind closed doors," Fitton said. "I'm tired of these secret testimonies before Congress."
Although Goodlatte said a transcript of the Rosenstein interview will be made available, Fitton questioned when an unredacted, unclassified version will be made public.
"So the same Justice Department that doesn't want to answer the questions is gonna be declassifying the material? Talk about a conflict," Fitton said.
He said Judicial Watch will continue doing its own watchdog work, because they simply don't expect much from Congress.
"Here you have Congress basically getting down and letting Mr. Rosenstein walk all over them. And it's just unbelievable to me."
