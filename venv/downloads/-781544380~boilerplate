Wojciech Cieszkowski — an avid runner who ran the Boston Marathon in 2013 — had no visible bruise marks on his face when he answered the door at his Pearl River, N.Y. home.
“You know, sore, but I’ll be fine,” he said.
The 49-year-old was tight-lipped about the alleged encounter and about Baldwin, 60, except to say that he’s “seen him [on SNL] a few times”
When asked if he’d watch Baldwin’s take on President Trump on the show again, he said, “I can’t say for now,” before driving off.
An unidentified Baldwin relative was holding a parking spot for the actor’s black Cadillac SUV on East 10th Street in Manhattan Friday afternoon when a driver in a black Saab swooped in and took the spot away, cops said.
When the Saab driver — police have not identified Cieszkowski as the alleged victim — hopped out to feed the meter, the hothead actor went ballistic on him, cops and witnesses said.
