An angry woman who had her belly button removed in an act of revenge against her estranged family now regrets her "impulsive" operation.
After her body was mutilated, she bizarrely sent the belly button to her then-boyfriend as a “present."
Paulina Casillas Landeros, 23, from Guadalajara in Jalisco, Mexico, fell out with her family as they disapproved of her way of life.
They were unimpressed with her tattoos and extreme body modifications such as a back corset – where piercings are created on either side of the spine, laced with ribbons and pulled tight – along with a split tongue.
Annoyed they didn’t approve of her lifestyle, she decided to remove her belly button out of spite, as it is "what makes us human".
