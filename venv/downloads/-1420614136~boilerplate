'Betomania' is resulting in some bizarre tributes for the Democratic candidate challenging Ted Cruz.
Though Rep. Beto O’Rourke is trailing Sen. Cruz in the polls, his fans haven’t lost their enthusiasm for the rocker-turned-congressman. Supporters have now painted giant murals of the Democrat and created viral – if not slightly cringe-worthy – videos for O’Rourke.
Though his legal name is Robert Francis O’Rourke, the Democrat goes by Beto – a nickname his followers have latched on to with their antics. In one video encouraging people to vote early for O’Rourke, an actress wore a jacket that said “Beto’s bandits.”
Here’s a look at three of the more over-the-top ways fans have shown their support for O’Rourke.
Dancing with the voters
A gaggle of O’Rourke fans showed their support for the candidate through song and dance.
Changing the words to the Village People’s “YMCA” song to spell out B-E-T-O, the revelers sang, “Texas, we can all celebrate because, Texas, there is one candidate who’s the hands down, clear-cut winner.”
