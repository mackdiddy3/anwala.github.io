Fiery actor and 'SNL' star Alec Baldwin has reportedly been arrested in New York City after allegedly punching someone in the face.
Hot-headed thespian Alec Baldwin has been charged with misdemeanor assault and harassment following his arrest Friday afternoon after he allegedly punched a man in New York City's ritzy West Village neighborhood, law enforcement sources tell Fox News.
Police sources say the frequent "Saturday Night Live" host was released around 4 pm ET from custody after getting into an argument over a parking spot. He is due back in court on November 26th.
In a video obtained by Page Six, Baldwin, 60, is seen walking out of the NYPD’s 6th Precinct station house in Greenwich Village. The actor kept quiet as he made his way towards a waiting car.
Law enforcement responded to a 911 call for an alleged assault around 1:30 pm EST, sources told Fox News, in which a 49-year-old male was treated for an injury to his left jaw. The individual was conscious and alert and transported to Lenox Hospital.
Hours after his arrest, Baldwin took to his family foundation's Twitter account to address the incident.
"Normally, I would not comment on something as egregiously misstated as today’s story," Baldwin wrote.
"However, the assertion that I punched anyone over a parking spot is false," he continued. "I wanted to go on the record stating as much. I realize that it has become a sport to tag people w as many negative charges and defaming allegations as possible for the purposes of clickbait entertainment."
Baldwin concluded: "Fortunately, no matter how reverberating the echos, it doesn’t make the statements true."
A rep for the actor had no comment when reached by Fox News.
Baldwin lives in the tony downtown Manhattan neighborhood with his wife, Hilaria Baldwin, 34, and their four children.
NYPD told Fox News at the time that Baldwin, who had no identification on him, "refused to [identify] himself, became belligerent, cursing and yelling. He was then placed in handcuffs."
Baldwin went on a Twitter rant after that arrest, posting the arresting officer's name and badge number. The actor tweeted that he was taken into custody while "photographers outside my home ONCE AGAIN terrified my daughter and nearly hit her with a camera. The police did nothing."
He then added, "New York City is a mismanaged carnival of stupidity that is desperate for revenue and anxious to criminalize behavior once thought benign."
Baldwin has had several other run-ins with the general public that did not involve law enforcement.

Baldwin has also had several other run-ins with the general public that did not involve law enforcement.
In 2011, the former "30 Rock" star was removed from a flight after refusing to stop playing the game "Words With Friends" on his phone.
In 2012, he was accused by a photographer of getting aggressive with him on a New York City street, and in 2013 another photographer filed a harassment claim against Baldwin.
The prickly man about town had been laying relatively low recently when it came to street scuffles, making more headlines for his frequent attacks on President Trump and his popular parody of the president on "Saturday Night Live."
But Trump didn't seem to take Baldwin's impersonation personally when asked about the actor's parking-spot spat at a gathering of reporters on the south lawn of the White House on Friday.
"I wish him luck," Trump said upon being informed of Baldwin's predicament.
Trump was asked about Baldwin's street scene at a Friday press event.

“It is time to overthrow the government of Donald Trump -- not in a violent way or unlawful way -- but it must be overthrown nonetheless," Baldwin told a crowd of some 800 party office-holders, candidates, officials and activists, drawing loud applause.
Baldwin also told reporters that he’s “always dreamed” of running for office himself, but explained it’s not in the cards for him at this time.
“My wife told me she’d divorce me if I ran for office,” he joked.
He also downplayed suggestions that his Democratic activism would limit the success of his struggling “The Alec Baldwin Show,” his new venture on ABC, which is scheduled to air this weekend as planned, despite Friday's arrest.
“'The Alec Baldwin Show’ will air as scheduled on Sunday,” an ABC spokesperson told Fox News.
