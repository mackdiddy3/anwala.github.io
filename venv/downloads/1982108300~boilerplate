An Air Force C-17 prematurely dropped a Humvee by parachute into rural North Carolina, military officials said Wednesday.
The drop was miles from the intended target, and no injuries were reported on the ground, in the town of Cameron, WTVD reported.
Fort Bragg spokesman Tom McCollum said the parachute opened and the vehicle landed in a wooded area between two homes between the Johnsonville and Spout Springs communities in Harnett County, about 7 miles north of Fort Braggâ€™s drop zones.
WTVD reported that the drop happened at around 1 p.m. during a training exercise.
McCollum said the heavy drop was part of a test conducted by soldiers from the Airborne and Special Operations Test Directorate.
