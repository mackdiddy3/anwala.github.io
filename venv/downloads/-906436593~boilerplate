Actor Todd Latourette told KOB 4 that he cut off and cauterized his right arm roughly 17 years ago while he was off his medications. He said he then lied about his injury over a decade later, saying it was incurred on the field of combat, in order to get an acting role, for which he is now apologizing.
“I severed my hand with a Skil saw,” he told the outlet. “The state of my mind was a psychotic episode.”
Latourette was later cast in roles because of the severed limb and a false story about being a war veteran. Most recently, he appeared in Season 4, Episode 5 of AMC’s “Better Call Saul.”
Latourette is back on his medication and says that living with the lie has been difficult, which is why he chose to come forward and admit to it now, despite the fact that it will likely hinder his acting career going forward.
"I was dishonorable. I'm killing my career by doing this, if anyone thinks this was for personal edification, that's not the case," says Latourette. "I'm ousting myself from the New Mexico Film Industry. And gladly so, just to say what I've said."
Representatives for AMC did not respond to Fox News’ request for comment on the matter.
Latourette, however, notes that he is not looking to be redeemed for what he’s done, but instead hopes that his story will help those who may be struggling with mental illness understand the gravity of taking their medication.
"The power is in your hands to take your medication in the morning, or at night. So that, this, this discourse of my life doesn't need to necessarily be yours. Because it happens quick... it happens quick."
Editor’s Note: A previous version of this story said Latourette cut his hand to get acting roles. Latourette said the incident had nothing to do with getting acting roles, and was due to his mental illness. He said the subsequent mistruth about his severed hand being a war injury happened more than a decade later. Fox News regrets the error.
