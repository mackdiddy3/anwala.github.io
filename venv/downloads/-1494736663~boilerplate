Former President Barack Obama on Friday said Republicans are trying to "terrify folks" ahead of next week's critical midterm elections.
Speaking at a rally for Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) and Democratic Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum in Miami on Friday, Obama called out "constant fear-mongering" on illegal immigration from the right.
"What we have not seen the way we are seeing right now is politicians just blatantly, repeatedly, baldly, shamelessly lie. Just making stuff up. That’s what they’re doing right now all the time," Obama said, adding that Republicans have employed a similar strategy in past election cycles.
He noted that heading into recent elections, Republicans got their base "wound up" about everything from reports of ObamaCare's "death panels" to Ebola to Hillary Clinton's emails.
He said this year Republicans are claiming that poor migrants seeking asylum or a better life are the "existential threat" facing America.
He warned Democrats about being distracted by the rhetoric and losing focus on the issues.
"Don’t fall for the okey doke. Don’t be bamboozled. Don’t be hoodwinked. Because when you get distracted, while you’re distracted with all this stuff they’re making up, they’re also robbing you blind," Obama said.
He said while the American people are distracted, Republicans give tax cuts to billionaires, go after health care and roll back environmental protections.
Following Michael Cohen's public testimony before Congress, Judge Andrew Napolitano said President Trump's former attorney alleged no impeachable offenses, but he did give Democrats a "treasure trove of stuff" with which to torment the president.
