(Pomona Police Department)
Pomona, California police Officer Greggory Casillas, 30, was fatally shot March 9 after he and another officer chased a suspect who "barricaded himself in a bedroom" and "began firing through the door" as officers tried to contact him, Capt. Christopher Bergner of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department told reporters. A second officer was injured, authorities said.
The confrontation led to a 15-hour standoff with authorities and ended with the suspect's arrest March 10, Los Angeles County Sheriff Jim McDonnell said.
"For the last 15 hours, we attempted to make an arrest of this individual and just did so successfully minutes ago," McDonnell said during a news conference.
The situation began when Pomona officers received a report of a "person driving recklessly," the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said in a statement. The suspect ultimately led police on a chase before crashing and fleeing on foot. The suspect then "ran into an apartment complex and the officers gave chase," Capt. Christopher Bergner of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said.

The alleged shooter, later identified as James Waters, opened fire from inside the house when officers tried to apprehend the individual. The suspect was found dead inside the home.
Since news of Morton's death broke, authorities announced that Morton and the other officers were sent to the wrong house -- about 15 miles away from where they were supposed to be.
"The 911 call that came in was somehow attached to that [Clinton] address," Missouri Highway Patrol Sgt. Bill Lowe said, according to the Kansas City Star.
Lowe said it was a "coincidence" the officers were directed to that address.
"It is tragic that happened. But the fact is they were in the act of committing crimes within that house," Lowe said. "When (the officers) entered that house, they were doing what they needed to ensure no one was hurt and there wasn't any other problems."
Lowe said the loss would greatly impact the "small department."
“It’s a small department. It’s small enough that you know each individual officer and the community knows each individual officer, and it’s hard to put into words when you’re talking about an agency of this size, a community of this size where something tragic like this happened just seven months ago,” he said.
Morton, a 30-year-old Army veteran, was with the Clinton Police Department from February 2015 through January 2017, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. He decided to return to the force after fellow officer Gary Michael was fatally shot at a traffic stop in August 2017.
