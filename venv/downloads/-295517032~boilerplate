THE LEAD STORY - TIME TO VOTE: It’s finally here. After hundreds of campaign rallies, billions of dollars in donations, a nonstop blitz of TV advertising and polling that’s been in full swing since summer, Election Day has arrived – and with it, voters' midterm verdict on whether Republicans should hold or lose their grip on power in Washington ... Democrats have been working toward this day since the moment President Trump was sworn in. They’ve waited two long years for the shot to win enough seats in Congress to cripple the 45th president’s agenda. In the end, the elections will go one of three ways: Republicans hold both chambers, Democrats take the majority in both, or the parties split the House and Senate. Either of the latter two scenarios would be problematic for Trump, immediately putting a damper on his agenda.
By the numbers, 35 Senate seats, 36 gubernatorial seats and 435 House seats are up for grabs on Tuesday. The stakes couldn’t be higher. Trump himself has been campaigning non-stop in recent days, telling voters they must keep Democrats from taking back control of the House and Senate, or his agenda could be in jeopardy. The party of the president has historically lost seats in their first midterm elections.
Here's the lay of the land on Election Day:
For Democrats, their best shot at winning back control of a body of Congress is in the House, where they need to net 23 seats for a majority. Whether they flip the House or not, Democrats are still expected to gain seats in the chamber, given the favorable political environment for Democrats.
Republicans currently hold a slim 51-49 majority in the Senate, and Democrats have long aimed to win back control. But it will be more difficult for Democrats to be victorious in the Senate by netting two seats in part because of the large number of incumbent Democrats running for re-election in states won by Trump in 2016.
Republicans currently control 33 governorships, with Democrats holding 16. But with 36 seats up this year, Democrats are likely to pick up at least some seats. According to the Fox News Gubernatorial Power Rankings, Republicans are favored to control at least 22 seats by the end of the night and Democrats are favored have at least 20 seats, with 8 additional toss-up races.
Election watchers could be in for a long night. The first polls, on the East Coast, close at 7 p.m. ET. After polls on the West Coast close at 11 p.m. ET, the last will close in Alaska at 1 a.m. ET. - Reported by Alex Pappas (@AlexPappas on Twitter)
TRUMP'S CLOSING ARGUMENT: President Trump on Monday night touted his administration's progress during his first two years in office as he gave a final push for Republican candidates hours before Election Day ... Speaking to FOX News host Sean Hannity in Cape Girardeau, Mo., Trump criticized the Obama administration's path and said that, "if their agenda kept going forward" the economy would have deteriorated. "We were going down. It was very bad when I took it over and if we didn’t open it up and cut regulations, the whole Obama thing would’ve collapsed," the president said on FOX News Channel. "It would’ve been a disaster."
Hannity's interview with the president was cut short as host Laura Ingraham, of "The Ingraham Angle," interjected — asking Trump what he wants to tell Americans who seek "calm and unity" among a divided nation. "Well I think success will do that," he said. "I think we have to get over this election, see how it comes out. It’ll be an interesting time. And I really think we have to do that first." - Reported by Nicole Darrah (@nicoledarrah on Twitter)
HOWARD KURTZ: WHY AREN'T DEMS RUNAWAY FAVORITES? - As the media are awash in predictions and prognostications about today's elections, one question I find fascinating is this: Why haven't the Democrats run away with this thing? ... After all, if Donald Trump is as terrible a president as the press has been proclaiming for nearly two years, the opposition party should be riding a wave of revulsion to victory. The Dems are favored to win the 23 seats needed to win the House, and some pundits are saying they'll take considerably more, but the fact that even the minimum outcome is in doubt shows a far more competitive election than was forecast a month or two ago.
So perhaps Trump, and the Republican candidates following his lead, are better at electoral politics than the wise guys thought. And you can't blame it all on "fear-mongering," even though the president has chosen to close on immigration rather than the booming economy ... A provocative theory comes from Ross Douthat, the conservative New York Times columnist and a sharp Trump critic. He cites the often-vast "gulf" between "the hysteria of liberals who write about politics for a living and the relative calm of Democrats who practice it.
FACEBOOK CRACKDOWN: Facebook on Monday evening said it identified about 30 accounts and 85 Instagram accounts flagged by law enforcement as having possible ties to foreign entities ... The social media giant said in a statement that it became aware of accounts that may be "engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior" on Sunday evening. The accounts were blocked and a further investigation is underway. “Almost all the Facebook Pages associated with these accounts appear to be in the French or Russian languages, while the Instagram accounts seem to have mostly been in English — some were focused on celebrities, others political debate,” the statement read. - Reported by Benjamin Brown (@bdbrown473 on Twitter)
SATURDAY NIGHT LOW: Pete Davidson, the ‘Saturday Night Live’ actor who joked that a former Navy SEAL’s eye patch made him look like a “hit man in a porno movie” reportedly improvised the last couple of lines of the attempt at laughter ... TMZ, citing sources, said the line about Texas Republican congressional hopeful, Dan Crenshaw, looking like a hitman was written into the script. But Davidson added the part about his injury on his own.
Davidson stirred up controversy during SNL's "Weekend Update" when he said Crenshaw's photo was "kinda cool," but that viewers might be "surprised he's a congressional candidate from Texas and not a hitman in a porno movie." He added, "I'm sorry, I know he lost his eye in the war or whatever." - Reported by Bradford Betz (@bradford_betz on Twitter)
