Former acting ICE Director Tom Homan praised President Trump's threat of military action at the southern border Sunday on Fox & Friends.
The president tweeted on Thursday that if necessary, he'd call in the U.S. military to stop the thousands of migrants attempting to gain illegal entry into the country.
....In addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught - and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!..
Homan said on Sunday that the option of military intervention to protect the border is one that needs to be on the table.

He also said that the controversial family separations that happened as a result of Trump's zero-tolerance policy at the border could have been avoided.
"The whole reason family separations happened was because Congress -- specifically the Democrats -- will not close the loopholes that are causing this stuff," he said. "If they would have closed these loopholes when we asked them to, none of this stuff would have been happening."
The president on Saturday labeled Democrats as "obstructionists" in a tweet and said that if they would come together, new immigration laws could be agreed upon in "less than one hour."
If the Democrats would stop being obstructionists and come together, we could write up and agree to new immigration laws in less than one hour. Look at the needless pain and suffering that they are causing. Look at the horrors taking place on the Border. Chuck & Nancy, call me!
Tomi Lahren joined Steve Doocy on "Fox & Friends" Thursday to preview the new episode of Fox Nation's "No Interruption," which investigates the murder of an American man in a popular tourist destination in Mexico.
