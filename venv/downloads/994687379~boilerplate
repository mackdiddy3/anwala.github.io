Nearly 2.5 million pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry taquitos have been recalled over concerns that the products may be contaminated with listeria and salmonella. According to a U.S. Department of Agriculture recall announcement, the issue concerns the onions used by Ruiz Food Products Inc. in their beef and cheese taquitos.
The products were shipped to retailers nationwide, but there have been no reports of adverse health effects related to the recall so far. Salmonella and listeria pose the most serious risk to older adults, people with weakened immune systems, pregnant women and infants. Eating food contaminated with salmonella may lead to abdominal cramps, diarrhea and fever, with illnesses lasting between four and seven days. Severe cases may require hospitalization but most patients typically recover on their own.
Listeria can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, or even convulsions. More serious symptoms may be preceded by diarrhea, and it can even cause fatal infections in severe cases.
