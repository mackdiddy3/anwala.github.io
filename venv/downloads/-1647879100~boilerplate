Good Samaritan aims to save her lifelong church from flooding by digging up the road
A 72-year-old woman is trying to save her church from sinking in debt after the city said it wouldn't help with an underground water leak.
A hardworking, faithful 72-year-old woman in Sacramento, California, is doing all she can to save the church she’s attended since she was five years old.
And just like the biblical story of the Good Samaritan, Maribeth Bean, told Fox 40 she’s been aided by some people passing by – especially homeless people — at Fruitridge Christian Church as the retired utility worker with a bad back digs with a shovel, trying to find the source of a massive underground leak.
